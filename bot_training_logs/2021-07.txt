[Music] okay so hello everyone am i audible or not let me know that am i audible or not thank you so much for patience thank you so much for waiting guys we are just starting the stream soon and it is for the tcs and qt and ninja hiring preparation for the 2022 batch and for the other batches that you are applied for the august 10 qt or the november enquity yes sir you are audible thank you so much thank you so much for confirmation friends we just start the live session 117 members join the today's live session thank you so much for all your all of your support friends and uh in this session there is a first important point that i just check all of your comments and dm on instagram that please make step by step video to crack tcs and qt and the ninja hiring because as we know that nqt and ninja hiring has cognitive and i t programming section so there is an very important point that if we want to do the preparation in a right manner or or in the last time so we have to prepare on the daily basis because as we know that tcs and qt and ninja exam in the august month so let's start the live session and there is one important point that if you have any doubt okay if you have any doubt so you can drop your query in that comment section and after all the questions all we are just i am just checking all of your doubts in the comments sir please speak in hindi most of them are hindi speaking so many candidates just dm me on instagram from today's morning that please make the live session or just take the live session in the english language okay okay so i just take a session in english because so many candidates no no go with english we are from south india okay okay okay okay there is no problem guys we are just taking hindi please consider my comment as well yes tcs nqt previous 10 years paper provided soon on the telegram channel south indians are there i am from andhra pradesh please speak english okay okay okay thank you so much okay hindi english okay mix we take the mixing uh we take the mixed language also english is good okay okay okay so we just started the today's live session and there is one important point that in the every live session okay in the every live session we just take the numerical ability questions plus verbal ability questions okay and uh the other part the logical ability verbal ability numerical ability and the logical part of the reasoning ability will take in the another section but at the last there is one coding question for all of you because it is important to prepare the it programming or the coding section also okay so let's start the live session if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section carry on the debate will on okay okay just i am just starting this session okay so the first question is x is four times as efficient as y in respect of doing a particular work working together they complete the work in 16 days and how many why working alone will able to half the work okay so there is one important point that in this question this he said that x is four times as efficient as y okay so x and y are doing a particular work but we have a condition that x is four times as efficient they are working together they completely work in 16 days so in how many days why working alone will be able to have the work okay so we have to find how many days why working alone firstly we have to find what are the number of days that by working alone and we will be able to have the work okay so for that i just add the solution in that pdf but i am just i'm just uh described here okay on the awd board okay so there isn't one important point that as we know that we say as in the question he said that x efficiency is four time okay so as we know that x is four times efficient then y okay so if if if if this is not clearly visible of or if this is not clearly understandable so you can check the you can check the solution here okay i just add the solution for all the questions here okay and i will share this pdf on the telegram channel also okay so as we know that the x efficiency is 4a and the efficiency of y okay and efficiency of y is a because he said that in the question x is 4 times efficient is y and time taken by both to complete a work is equals to 16 days in the question he said that time taken to complete by work is 16 days both okay for the both what are the time required to complete a work is that okay so as we know that x efficiency is for a uh okay so the a is uh for time efficient than y and the y efficiency is a okay so there is an one important point that we have to consider the efficiency factor following okay and we just take the value here and both are doing a particular work in the 16 days so why we take this here because we have to find the y working okay we have to find what are the number of days that the y work and alone in the half okay so we just take 1 by 4 a plus 1 by a is equals to 1 by 16 and we just take the common from here okay and 1 plus 4 by 4 a and as we know that this is not change this is just a 1 by 16 okay so we have to find the number of days that y working and we will be able to half the work okay so if we want to find that so the particular a value comes here is 20 if you solve with this equation so we will got the value of a is equals to 20 hence okay so there is a problem that there isn't one important conclusion that x is equals to 20 means x will do the work in 20 days and why we'll do the work in 80 days why we just why we just increase that okay we have to just increase this value because we have to find the y value okay so if the y working in 80 days total number of days is 80 okay so the uh if we want to find the value of b also so the y value is 80 and after that why will we do half of work in 40 days so the correct answer for this question is 40 as you can see that this is the complete solution for this question okay efficiency of x is 4a as we know that y is and we just solve the question in this manner okay so you can just check this also and you can check this pdf okay if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section okay so let's move on to the second question that is very important and as we know that this type of questions are generally asked in the numerical ability section as well as in the other section also okay i just rub that okay if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section i am just checking the comment but yeah the collection of numbers which compromise the data given below is arranged in ascending order 379 n1518 1920 if the median of data is 12.5 what is the value of a what is the value of n so as we know that we just give we have a data and it will be given below arranged in the ascending order as we can see that and if the median of data is 12.5 so what is the value of n so we have just option like 10.5 11.5 11 12 and we just solve with the question in what in the manner okay i just open the awd board okay so as we know that what is the median of even data okay there is a very important point that we have to find if the median of data okay as we know that what is the median here the median here is 12 point the median here is 12.5 okay and we have to find the value of n so there is an one important point that we know that median i just take this pdf because uh this is not working right now okay so as we know that we have to find the collection of number which compromise the data that is given below okay that is given below and as we know that we have to these numbers are arranged in ascending order if the median of data is 12.5 what is the value of n okay so we we want to find the value of n so the what is the median of even data as we know that sum of middle term divided by 2 okay so this sum of middle term is n minus 1 as we know that this data are arranged in the ascending order okay the the data given below is arranged in ascending order 1 15 18 19 20 okay and uh 3 7 9 okay this all are arranged in ascending order and we have to find the value of n so we median of even data is sum of middle term divided by 2 so n minus 1 uh plus 15 okay so as you can just count this the number and uh the sum of middle term divided by 2 so the sum of middle term is n minus 1 plus 15 as you can see that so we just divided by 2 so what is the value of what is the value here that is the value of 12.5 okay so in the option there uh if if the median of data is 12.5 so what is the value of n so we have to find the value of n okay so the value of n particular here okay so the value of particular n here is we just take the values from that and we just find the value of n okay so let's move on to the next question that is after per se after purchasing two copies okay after purchasing two copies of the same book x sold them respectively at 0.8 and 1.4 time their cost prices what was the percentage gain earn or loss incurred by x okay so the option are given that ten percent lost five percent ten percent for these options are just two three four are repeating okay so we just take the solution here let the cost price of each copy is rupees 100 okay after purchasing after purchasing two copies of the same book x sold them respectively at 0.8 and 1.4 time their cost prices okay so we uh we just take the value that let the cost price of each copy will rupees 100 and according to the question one copy is sold as 0.8 into 100 okay because x sold them respectively at 0.8 so the value is 80 and one copy is sold at 1.4 into 100 okay q because 1.4 times their cost prices okay so we have to consider this so the total money is spent in buying the copies because we we just take we just buy the copy we just buy the two copies okay so here are the value is 200 and total money earn after selling the copy like according to the question one copy sold at this price and second copy sold at this price so we just total money earned after selling the copy is 20 20 uh to 20 rupees okay because we add the 80 plus 140 rupees after that total gain of rupees 20 we have to just find what are the total gain in here therefore gain is 10 percentage because as we know that we just buy the two copies but it will be one copy sold at this point uh this rate and the second copy sold as this rate so we have just a total gain of rupees 20 so the therefore gain is 10 percentage okay so friends if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section here answer is 11 okay so the answer is 11 is now answer is 11 in the second question as you can see that the answer is 11 but we have to find the value of n okay so the diameter okay so the i just take this question here and uh the diameter of a pizza is 30 centimeter and what is the area in centimeter square of the upper surface of a sector of the pizza whose arc length is 8 centimeter okay so as we know that area of sector when arc is given okay so we have to first just take this area of sector when arc is given is equals to l into r divided by 2 because we have to find the area in centimeter square okay where l is equals to length of arc and r is equals to radius of circle okay so the length is 8 centimeter given and r is 15 centimeter the diameter is a 30 centimeter and just we just take the radius okay so we just divide it by the two so the radius is given 15 centimeter then we have just to find the area like we have just to find the area like 8 is equals to area is equals to length into r okay so we just in we just multiply the length into radius divided by 2 so the final value is 60 centimeter square because we have to find we have to what is the area in centimeter square so the area is just like that friends i know that there isn't one important point that i not discussed in the awd board and i just share this solution with all of you because it is clearly understable because so many candidates just to say in previous session that this in this part this is not clearly visible that's why i just take the solution here it will be better if you explain it from pdf server without writing yes sure i just explained from the pdf okay i just uh take here okay so as you can see that okay so just uh from the next pdf i uh from the next live session i just i just take all the related details and all the uh complete points that are very important for understanding also okay so the this question is very important i just take the value for that what is the mean deviation of the data okay what is the mean deviation of the data 8 9 12 4 12 15 16 20 24 30 30 to 34 and the answer is 10 2 8 0 9 okay so these are the values that is given so what is the mean deviation of the data how to find mean deviation of data there are the three steps that comes under the solution we have to find the mean of data first okay we have just add this all the values with the respective and find the distance of each value from that mean and find the mean of those distance okay we just uh we just solve with this question on the awd board because this is very important okay so we just take the mean of data also and you just you just check the questions here and there isn't one important point that we have to find the mean of data first value okay so find the mean okay so what are the values here i just write here 8 okay so what are the values 8 plus 9 plus 12 plus 15 okay so 8 plus 9 okay so you have to add all the values here okay so 8 plus 9 plus 12 plus 15 plus okay so the plus is 16 20 24 30 16 20 24 30 i think there are some values left 30 30 to 34 okay so we just take the values that 32 and 34 okay so we just add all this value by 10 because this value are 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 okay so we just divided by 10 so the value is when we add this so 8 plus 9 plus 12 20 24 30 32 34 200 so the value is comes 200 here okay and we just divided the value here so we just got the answer as in 20 that is mean okay so this is the first step that we complete okay after just after uh we take the second step okay after just we take the second step here so there isn't one important point that we have to find the distance of each value from that mean okay each value from that mean okay so we have to just find the distance from 20 okay so if the distance from each value from that mean so the value 8 and the 20 distance is distance from 20 is 12 okay so as you can see that okay after that there isn't one important point there isn't one important point we have to find all the distance here okay so the next value is nine okay so the nine and 20 distance is 11 and after that 12 and 20 distance is 8 okay and after that 15 and 20 distance is 5 okay after that 16 and 20 distance is 4 and after that 20 and 20 distance is 0 okay and after that 24 and 24 or 20 4 and 20 distance is also 4 after that 30 and 24 distance is 10 okay 30 and 20 distances okay 30 and 20 distance is 4 and the 32 okay 32 and the 20 distance is 12 and at the last 34 and the 20 distance is 14 okay so these are the value that we have find to find the distance this is the second number step after that after that we have just to find the last step i just add the step in that find the mean of those distance okay we have to find this mean distance 12 plus 11 plus 8 5 4 0 4 10 12 14 okay so these are the values this all one two three four five six seven eight nine ten these are divided by ten okay and the final value comes from here that 80 divided by 10 so this is the mean deviation for the question and the answer is b okay so this type of questions we have to solve and this is the concept for solving that question okay great going brother great growing brother thank you so much tekken target thank you so much i'm sure it's okay so the seventh of uh this is the sixth fifth question and after that we have to move on fifth question uh sixth question the mean of set of data is five what will be mean okay what will be mean if the ten is subscript subs okay we have the mean of set of data is 5 what will be mean if 10 is subtracted from each data okay so the let the number of data be n okay we have a mean of set of data is 5 what will be the mean if 10 is subtracted from each data okay so we have to find what will be the mean if we just subtract from each data so they let the number of data be n so the sum of data is mean into number of data so e is equals to 5 n now 10 is subtracted to each data because he said in the question that what will be the mean if 10 is subtracted from each data okay so we just take we just take the value that now 10 is subtracted to each data so the now the sum becomes a 5 and minus 10 n is equals to minus 5 n and we have to find the mean also the sum of data divided by number of data so the sum of data value is so minus 5 and as we know that and the number of data is n because he said that in this question okay so if we just to solve that question so n cancel by n so the value is 5 so the new mean become minus 5 so the correct answer is first so this type of questions are generally asked in the numerical coding section okay i think this question is repeat in that okay so we just leave that question and we just solve with the last question uh okay so the eighth question is the next question that car a leaves a ctc at 5 pm and drives at a speed of 40 kilometer okay so the car a leaves the ctc at 5 pm and drives at a speed of 40 kilometer per hour two hours later another car b leaves ctc and drives in the same direction as car okay so we have two values okay car a uh they will both will leave the city c from different timing as we know that uh on the uh car a is this city at 5 pm and drive at a speed of 40 kilometer per hour two hours later after two hours okay so the another car b leaves a city c and drives in the same direction so this in how much time okay these are the option this is not in how much time will car be nine kilometer ahead of car a if the speed of car b is 60 kilometer per hour okay so we have to find in how much time will car a be nine kilometer ahead of car a if the speed of car b is 60 kilometer per hour so we have a speed of car that is speed of car a is 40 kilometer per hour and speed of car b is 60 kilometer per hour distance traveled by a in two hours because we have to find the distance traveled in two hours so first after that we have just move on to the next part so the distance traveled by a in two hours is equal to distance the formula of distance is distance is equals to speed into time so we just we just take the speed what is the time here 2 and 80 kilometer distance b must travel to be nine kilometer ahead of a okay we have just given in this question that they have just given in this question we have to find the distance b also so it will be 80 kilometer plus nine kilometer because it is mentioned in that question that in how much time will car a b be nine kilometer ahead of car if the speed of car b is 60 so the 80 kilometer is the distance that is traveled by a in the two hours and the nine kilometer as b must be traveled to nine kilometer ahead of a so the 89 kilometer so what is the relative speed of a and b okay so we have to find the because in that question in this question so the speed of car is 60 kilometer per hour so the relative speed of a in b is 60 minus 40 is equals to 20 kilometer per hour time taken by b to be nine kilometer ahead of a so the time is equals to distance upon speed and uh is equals to 89 kilometer that is traveled by distance b and 20 meter 20 kilometer per hour is the relative speed okay so the time taken by b to be nine kilometer ahead is 4.45 hours this is the question that is just in this say that in that question and this is the concept we just implemented in that question okay so the ninth question is a number divided by 357 leave five as the remainder if the number is divided by 17 what is the remainder okay uh there is a number that is divided by 357 leaves a 5 as remainder okay so we have just a value that 357 leave 5 as a remainder if number is divided by 17 so solution is just here that here 357 can be written in multiples of 17.357 means 17 into 21 when you just multiply this you got this value from the dividend rule we just take the division dividend is equal to division into quotient plus remainder coefficient plus remainder let the dividend let the dividend on number be n because we have to find if the number is divided by 17 so what is the remainder and 5 is already present in the remainder so the let the dividend uh let the dividend or number be n and the quotient be x so it can be written as n is equals to 357 into x because we have the value and plus 5n okay so the remainder that is the 5 as remainder okay so it will be it will be right in that form and we just to solve with this value so the remainder will be five in this case two so the correct answer is five okay so we just uh we just take uh the uh we just take the break we just take the break here for that because we have just we have just take the break of five minutes here okay i this time okay so thank you so much nyan for membership thank you so much for coming to the channel uh can you give the question show your last question okay so as you can see that this is the last question here okay and this is the one sentence okay i just check all your comments in the 16 11 sir can you place that pdf with explanation in the description please yes yes yes soon sir i got one answer because sir can you share this video yet it will be tech teach coding man okay soon so i respect you are very helpful session thank you so much in question number six i will just share all the can you share this pdf is with us yes yes i will share all the pdf with all of us okay so i think just we start the session again and there isn't one important point that if you find a good session if you find a good content please like and share this with your friends okay so before moving to verbal ability so there is an one important point that you have to practice very well for this section because i just checked so many candidates and cuties for previous year and there are number of less marks in the verbal ability section because we just solve the numerical ability and the other parts also but in the verbal ability candidates so much confusing in that so i just take not so many questions in that pdf and i just take the only seven question for the verbal ability and from the next session i just take this so many questions for me verbal ability okay uh sir how can i prepare for coding face prep yes i just take some of the questions from face prep website because the face prep website is very good for preparation and i just say in so many my session that the face prep is a very good website for placement preparation you can just check the questions from that website also but this questions are just for the prepare for all of you because these are the previous year questions okay so there isn't one important point okay reading comprehension is difficult to answer is one minute yes reading comprehension question is also difficult to answer but we have to just take the how to prepare for verbal ability for verbal ability you have to solve so many questions on the daily basis and soon in the upcoming videos i just uh check and i just uh i just share all the strategy that are for the each section okay i just shared the strategy that uh how to prepare for each section like numerical verbal or the coding or the other section okay so let's move on to the verbal ability question and the first question is one part of the sentence below may contain an error identify the part if there is no error choose no error everyday life have become more complicated with the advancement in the mobile technology okay so as you can see that i just uh take this solution for two question only because from the third question i will explain all the other things but in the first or second question also so the one part of sentence may below content error okay so as we know that every day life have okay have become more complicated with the advancement in mobile technology okay as we know that every day life become more complicated okay we know with the advancement in mobile technology so the error is every day life has become because life is a singular not other okay so we just take the right answer as everyday life has become more complicated with the advancement in the mobile technology because life is a singular here okay and as you can see that this question is the solve and everyday life has become the second question is the following sentence okay i just uh just check all the uh all the points here and uh there isn't one important point that okay so this is the one important uh this is the one important point uh this is the one important point that the following three sentence can be revised into one better sentence okay choose the sentence that is the best division i was at the fair i got lost i got scared okay i was at the fair i got lost i got scared so there isn't one important point i just uh not described here okay so one minute friends okay so as we know that we are the three given sentences as you can see that i was at the fair i got lost and i got scared so the three given sentences are presented in past tense so the combined uh combined sentence should also be represented in the past tense because you can see that i was at the fair i got lost i got scared okay applying this condition we have we wanted to remove or eliminate the option a and c because in this two option the combined sentence is represented in present tense okay so i was at the fair i got lost i got scared okay so as you can see that this is the three given sentences and in the uh in the first sentences not in that okay i understand my point here that is one point there here i just talk about the option option first okay so as you can see that uh i am scared after i am lost at the fair i am scared okay madara uh uh i am scared after i am lost at the fair i am lost to the fair so i am too scared okay so as you can see that in this given three sentences in the option a and c it will be in the present okay so in the three sentences it will be in the past and in the first and third sentences it will be in the present in option b okay so in option b the combined sentences i went to fare and got scared as i was lost but the action of person going to the fair is not described in any of the given individual sentence i went to the fair and got scared as i was lost so this option is not correct because we just remove the a and uh first and third option firstly because it is in the present tense and this complete sentence in the past tense so the combined sentence is also in the past returns okay so the does the remaining option d is the correct answer if we consider the same if i got lost at the fair and was scared okay so is the one which relate all the three given sentences without changing the meaning so the correct answer is 4 because he said that i got lost at the fair and was scared okay so the correct answer is 4 okay so this sentence combine all the element 3 sentence with the proper use of conjunction in tenses okay so we have just uh move on to the next question that is very important and this is just related to any team with two ballers sharing the required traits is arrow gained to its opponent okay so there is a team with two ballers that is sharing the required threats is arrogance to its supposing opponents were unable to choke hard to defeat insignificant in its contribution okay so there is an one important point that in the game of cricket any side with a pair of ballers of complementing qualities provisable invincible okay so these are the words that are just used for the these are the words that are just used for that any team with two bowlers sharing the required taxes not arrogance to its support opponents because they are just sharing the required threads vulnerable to chalk is hard to defeat okay because this can be answered by going through the very first line of passage in the game of cricket okay so this is just related to a passage i just not add the passage here because i just want to explain with another concept okay so the correct answer is hard to defeat that is invincible okay which statement is correct according to this passage okay so there isn't one important point that there isn't one important point that research about vaccine is not reliable all pandemics are not to be feared panademics keep operating periodically there is no solution for pandemic okay so just uh just understand the option a okay we just take all the option here okay we just take the all option here research about the vaccine is not reliable so in option a it is state that research about vaccine is not reliable uh but there isn't one important point it do not represent such idea of vaccine that any part in the passage okay so this is just related to passage also okay so the passage is just about vaccine that if we if india if in india if in india there is a vaccine implemented so what about the research here so all these type of questions are generally asked in that and in the next video i just discussed because this is the passage question okay so i just take the next question here that is select the most appropriate opera option to complete the senses complete the sentence the final report on the project was into three parts okay so we just take each option broken up broken off broken away broken out let's first consider the meaning of phrasal verbs that is given the phrasal verbs are just that the broken up has more than one meaning okay so the first is that it will be split up split up or separate so the phrasal verb so the phrasal verb breakup has more than one meaning so the final report on the project was broken up into three parts okay so the correct answer is broken up because break off has also more than one meaning to remove or something but we have to just report on the project was just into three parts not to remove in the other parts or in the other parts broken away means to escape means we have to just escape that and break out has also more than one meaning is to occur suddenly okay so the broken out is not the correct answer away means is cap and off is to remove and broke up up is to convert and divide into some parts okay so the sixth question is what purpose do the call of birds serve okay so they help them locate other birds they show them the direction during flight they help the male secure their territory they assist them in finding food okay so there isn't one important point this is just related to passion a passage question also for passage question i will just share in next live session with all of you for that passage question because for the passage i have just to prepare all the other pdf also okay and this is just related to passage also so in the next video i just take the passage related question okay so this is the coding question that we solve for today's live session last sir could you repeat please uh sir instead if you explain concept first and discuss i may help you because it will i think sir okay please suggest how to prepare in the next live session coding section okay so we just take the coding section uh sorry friends for the verbal ability question i just take the passage question here but not as the not at the complete passage here uh okay so in the next live session we just discuss about verbal and other with the correct passage and how we can solve with the passage question here okay so for uh that today's live session the coding question is we have to print a unique element is in array write a program to print the unique unique element that is in the given array so the first line of input denote the size of an array n and the remaining line of input denotes the n element print all the unique element sample input is 5 1 1 2 2 3 so there is a sample output 3 because as we know that what are the some unique element that is in the array okay so as we know that the sample output print we have to print all the unique element that is in the array so i just open okay i just open the c plus plus compiler here and let's we make this code first okay because this is very important that we have to uh we have to also prepare the coding section also and the programming section also okay so we i just make the code in c plus plus include okay so we just uh include i o stream include for that i just take the include i o stream if there is an error we just take the different library here okay so using name space because we have to find the uh we have to find here the unique element here from that okay so we have just uh we have just created the main function here and there isn't very one important point that we have to solve with the coding question here we have to print the all the unique element that is given in that okay so we just take the values that we have just to take the value for n for i for j and we have just declared the flag flag is equals to flag is equals to 0 here for that because we just take the value here and we uh we wanted to find the value that is very important for that and we just see in the input here and after that okay after that we just we just take the value of hint array and it will be treated as in the array because there are so many values that is given in that five one one two two three okay so after that for i equals to 0 and i is less than and i plus plus because we have to find the value from that section also okay so we have just take the values of values one by one here in that array and after that we have another for loop for taking for taking the other values also okay we have just a for loop for uh we have just another for loop for taking the other values that are very important okay so the first point is that you have to just to check the concept here we have just defined the flag again here with the 0 and we have another for loop for checking the value that is in that and because we have to find the we have to find the we have to just to find the unique element that is in the that is given in that okay so i just uh take the code okay so the if array okay we have to just check the condition here if array of i is equals to array of j and i is not equals to i is not equals to j why we take this condition we take this condition because this condition is very important for checking the value and in this we have just declared the flag as one okay initialize the flag is one and just break here okay so this will the value this will check the value that is related to that and okay and after that we just we just take the another values that is very important and if flag is equals to 0 like equals to equals to 0 in that condition because we have to check the values here okay because we have to check the values here okay if flag equals to 0 0 okay so this we have to print the unique element that is in the array because bits it will be check the complete condition here okay so we have just uh check the values okay so so there isn't very one important point that we just written here with this zero okay so i think uh this should be complete and this should be work uh but if we run that okay so we just check that there is an error okay so what are the errors here okay so we just check what are the numbers of okay what are the numbers of that is in the return zero okay that is in the return zero we just checked the error here okay we have expected declaration before token okay so we have just to check compilation okay i think this is not working but if we work this written expected declaration okay so we just take the value here from that okay so there isn't one important point that we have to just check all the uh here okay so we just take the value here and if the value is 1 here 1 and there is a for loop for that and in this there is a for loop for second for i is equals to 0 there is an another for loop and if flash equals to 1 and we just break that okay so this there here is one for that and for one and four okay so if we run again okay so i think this will be working and we just uh check the values here five one one two two three okay five one one two two five five one one two two three okay i think the output should be come here as you can see on my screen that we have just printed the unique elements here and we just implemented the concept here i hope this live session is very useful for all of you that's why it is giving an error you have written it oh yes yes i just i just check all the braces here and as you can see on my screen that we have just printed the output here i think this live station is very useful for all of you if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section but from next video you can share your comments and your valuable feedback that i have to just take the class in english or hindi and the language i know is only java uh sir give five problem daily to solve it so that we have to crack tcs ninja on the telegram group bro can you solve in python python should i focus more on coding aptitude and you have to just you have to just focus on all this section sir please upload this video yes this video is very nice explanation thank you so much for sir instead of yes okay so i just check okay please suggest the best aptitude for tcs you can check the india pixel website another face is there any negative marking no can we prepare for tcn ninja on youtube you can so please share this point okay so from the next video i just through this live session can we correct tcs yes but from the next session okay uh okay i just share uh the telegram link with all of you here okay wait wait friends wait wait wait thank you so much for all of your support and okay so i just share with all of you okay so i just add this is the telegram link as you can join thank you sir thank you so much for joining the today's session thank you so much friends for all of your support sir is the content content you are providing is sufficient to crack sir please upload this video yes yes python

I have attended non technical  part of tcs ninja irc test . But i can't  able  to attend it programming  part ,it shows  like i have submitted  already .
sir if i could not singn up and attend for meeting then is there any disadvantage
Hi sir.. Actually I have done my diploma and then joined BTech. In TCS application what should I fill in highest degree ? Is it Diploma or currently pursuing btech ? Could you please help me out sir ? thank you.
TCS apply drive karne par error aara hai kisi ko aara hai kya? pls help me
Sir please tell that whether tcs nqt and ninja will be in same date or not?
When we were having paid Aug nqt exam?
Sir i finished my infosys SES Interview on 1st july,2021 yesterday i got a call from a person in infosys, he asked when did u attend ur hackwithinfy round 1 test. What this means, will i get selected?
Is 2022 batch get interview call base of feb 2021 nqt score
Sir please speak English because there is a different state people will follow you
Bro if someone got less than 60% then they will allow us if we crack the exam. Because many people have query that they are allowing to give the exam but when going for interview firstly they check the 12th marksheet and if we got less than 60% they directly eliminate the students.
I have mistakenly put certification which I have deleted the same at the time of registration... But in the application form and pdf it is still showing... What to do ? I have contacted TCS support.

=== Mountblue Algorithm Question Practice | Coding Exam | Hiring 2021/2022 Batch ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=Rg05CZQQ-SM

Transcript:
hello everyone i am lokesh and welcome back to the channel so friends this video is related to mount blue algorithm coding question practice and this is the first part video on the on the tomorrow morning i just uploaded the second part but before we see the first part video and in this video we see about some algorithm coding question that is of medium level plus advanced level and as we know that mount w exam on the first august so let's start the video okay so as you can see that on the hacker rank algorithm section there are so many questions present for that okay you have to solve on some of the important topic like strings dynamic programming greedy bit manipulation and recursion okay something about there are questions from graph theory and the game theory also but you have to practice more questions from that okay if you if you just practice on some different website like hacker earth or the code shop so it will be very good okay so this is the some beginner or beginners not say like this is the intermediate questions that the question name is larry's array larry has been given a permutation of a sequence of natural number incrementing from one as an array he must determine whether the array can be shorted using the following operation any number of time okay choose any three consecutive indices and rotate their element in such way that abc is equals to bca and after that cab and after that abc okay as you can see that we have to uh we have to just a natural we have we have a sequence of natural number and we have to increment from 1 as an array whether the array can be sorted using the following operation any number of time okay for example if a is equals to one six five two four three okay so as you can see that we have to first rotate that like uh we uh in that as you can see that abc so the bca so we have to just rotate the first following things after that five to six after that five four three after that six three five and five six four and as you can see that at the last there is an sorted array that is called the one two three four five six okay we have unsorted so we have to convert into sorted by using some rotate operation in the other operation okay and if it will on a new line for each test case print yes if a can be fully sorted means if it will be fully sorted so we have to print a yes okay otherwise print no so we have a function uh that is called the larry array and it must written a string either yes or no and the input format is the first line content and integer t the number of test cases the next pair of lines are called what are the constraint and what is the sample input as you can see that so the sample input is yes yes sample input is this and the sample output is yes yes no in the explanation as you can see that if the value of a 0 is 3 1 2 okay so we have to rotate the 3 1 2 and a 1 will be go to 1 2 3 so a is now sorted so we have print on new line if i talk about one three four two okay so this is the number of text cases whether it will be passes for that so the one three four two will be rotate three four two so the a1 will be one four two three now as you can see that a1 is one four two three we have to rotate again and there is a a2 value that is called one two three four so the a is now sorted we have to print on yes on new line test case two no sequence of rotation will result in sorted a thus print no on new line okay for that we have just to implement the concept using very simple uh concept as you can see that we have to just make the code and we have just take the first input in range because we have to just check the what are the number of test cases value after that we have to we have input okay as we know that we have just different type of input value and all the input value are given in the list format okay so this is the very important point that because we have to just perform the rotation operation so we have just take the value after that after that as you can see that we have initialized this sum is equals to zero because we start from the zero okay so another for loop for rotating the value okay and this is the very important point that we have to just take the another for loop okay after that we have another for loop for values rotation as you can see that we have to uh we have to just check the values from i plus 1 okay n okay so we have just to check the value from that and we just to check the value that if a of j okay if a of j is less than a of i okay why we consider this because we have to rotate the value and arrange in the sorted manner okay so this sum will be increases by 1 and if it will be not okay and if it will be not so we just the print the yes value okay yes we have to print the yes value if some if some percentile okay i just put that if some okay if we print that yes if some percentile 2 equals to 0 means the value is 0 else we have to print the no because we check the values for the rotation okay i just run that code and see that a number of test cases is passed or not as you can see that congratulations sample test is zero and sample test case one is passed but this is not sufficient because we have to just running the all the test cases okay so as you can see that this is the solution that is related to this question but this is just okay so this is just a intermediate question okay because there are the three quoting question that is asked on the first august exam for the mount w exam so if i talk about the hard level question so as you can see that this is the algorithm hard question that is for the making candies you have to make and you have to make candies according to the machine and workers what are the machines and the workers are required for making the candies and as you can see that this type of questions are generally asked in the heart level or in the some other question okay so if we check this so the first is basic question second is intermediate and third is very hard question so you have to prepare so many questions from here okay algorithms section like string concepts or sorting graph theory greeting dynamic programming okay this type of concepts are generally asked in the coding examination okay because there is another coding round after this coding round so you have to practice well for the first august exam and just practice all the or some of the algorithm question that is ask okay and uh if i talk about previous year question so i lo i search a lot of a lot and but there is no previous year questions for the specific exam there is only that i just talked to candidates those they are selected those they are selected in the mount w okay so they said that you have to prepare fully algorithm and data structure section and some of the algorithm question so i hope this video is useful for everyone if you have any another doubt you can drop your query in the comment section from tomorrow we started the live session for the tcs ninja hiring and the august nqt preparation for numerical reasoning verbal coding programming all section okay daily on the daily basis there is a live session for all of you because so many candidates just drop a comment or just dm me on instagram that please make videos for the tcs nqt preparation thanks for support thanks for watching the video

=== TCS NQT Preparation | C Programming Crash Course | PDF NOTES | Crack Ninja &amp; NQT Exam ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=eZJDwNqP-ic

Transcript:
hello everyone i am lukesh and welcome back to the channel so friends this is the first video for the tcs nqt preparation and the tcs ninja hiring preparation and this is video related to c programming crash course in which we study most important topics or from start for the c programming and there is a one important point that it will be from form today to 28 august 2021 okay because as we know that after 30 august or before 30 august there is a exam of tcs ninja hiring or the tcs august nqt and this video is for the ninja and nqt preparation if you are from 2017 to 23 batch or from 2018 to 23 batch you are you can watch this video and you can share this video with your friends because i just share all my notes with all of you and this is the handwritten notes also plus as well as some topics also so this is the part one video and as well as in the upcoming videos i will started this series that is related to object oriented programming and i just make the complete video for the object oriented programming for the data structure and for the other subject so let's start the video so the first thing that you have noticed in the ninja hiring and nqt preparation there is an mcq questions from the c programming okay so you have to understand the basic concept of c as well as the advanced concept plus programming practice for the programming practice i just uploaded the other videos on the channel you can check from channel okay there are so many videos that i uploaded that is related to tcs ninja preparation series numerical ability as you can check that okay so uh in the today's video we talk about the some important topic that is or some introduction topic that is related to c language that what is c language history of c sample program example character set c tokens keyword identifier constraint variable data type operator and expression all operator managing input and output operation some important concept and there is a one important point that this video is totally on the time stamp basis okay so you have just to go to timestamp part and you can check the video but on the premiere you can just check the video okay so what is the c language okay as we know that c seems a strange name from for a programming language but this strange surrounding language is one of the most popular computer language today because it is structured high level machine independent language it allows software to develop program without worrying about the hardware platforms where they will be implemented okay so this is the just related to history of c c was generally evolved from algol bcpl and b by dennis ritchie at the bell laboratories in 1972. okay so as we know that dennis ritchie just made the c languages and it will be evolved from some of the programming language like algol bcpl basic combined programming language b language c uses many concepts from this language and added the concept of data types or the data structures and the other powerful features okay so it can c can be defined by the following way why c is the more popular or the most important as we know that c is the mother languages and the system programming languages procedure oriented programming languages structured and the middle programming languages for the history of c you can see that the first language is just introduced at the l goal okay so in the 1960 there is an algo language and the root of all modern language is algol okay so that will be introduced in the early 1960s uh algol is the first computer language to use a block structure okay after that in 1967 martin ricciard's developed a language called bcpl that is called the basic combined programming language okay so it's will generally for a primary for writing system software okay in 1970 okay in 1970 cam thompson just created the just created a new language that is called the b language and it will take the features of bcpl basic combined programming language but it were used to clearly version of unix operating system okay so it will be totally different from the bcpl after that there is a language called the uh there is a language c okay the traditional c is introduced in the year 1972 after that there are so many languages as you can see that and c was standard community by ncc in the 1989 and after that on the 1990 year there is an ieso committee that generally stand at the way of c language and standardization committee just approved the c99 okay in the 1999 year after that there are so many languages during the same period sun microsystem of usa created a new language called the java okay so as we know that this is the complete history for the sea but if i talk about importance of c so c has some of the importance like the c compiler benefits so what are the some c compiler benefits okay so the c compiler combines the capability of an assembly language with the features of high level language okay and there is an one important point like it will be well suited for system software and the system software and the business packages okay so there are only 32 keywords in the c and it will totally strengthen lie in its built-in function okay so c is highly portable the portability means that c program written from one computer can be run on another with little or no modification and it will be well suited for structured programming that user to think a problem in terms of function modules or block and its ability to extend itself okay the ability to accent itself like the c program is basically a collection of function that are supported by the c library okay so these are the some importance of c okay so this is the sample program that we have to print a message okay and there are so many parts that i considered in this section but if you want some basic parts also so you can check my handwritten note and i will share on my blog okay so you can just check the link in the description and you can check what are the some topics that i cover in my handwritten notes okay so that is related to the printing uh this is the sample program that is related to printing a message okay so let us have a close look to that program okay so the first line inform the system uh the first line inform the system that the name of program is main and the execution is okay and the execution begins from this line the main is a special function that is used by c system to tell the computer where the program start means the program is start from here okay every program okay every program have exactly one main function if we use more than one function of one main function the compiler cannot understand which one marks the beginning of program okay so the main function is very special function this is for the beginning of program okay so the empty pair okay as you can see that why we use mpt pair here so the empty pair of parentheses we call this is parenthesis so the immediately following main indicate that function has no argument or parameter okay so this is just the empty pair of parentheses means there is a no uh there is no function there is no argument so there is no parameter uh that is okay so this is very important point okay so the opening braces in the second line okay so we i just talked about the opening braces so the opening braces in the second leg marks the beginning of function main okay and the closes uh closing braces will just release that the marks at the end of the program all the statement okay all the statement between these two braces from the function body means this is the totally function body okay this is starting and this is the closing okay and this all the function body okay so there is an one important point that in this case the function body contain only as you can see that the function body contains the three statement or we can say that there is an important okay there is an important point that what do you mean by printf okay so the printf is the function okay the printf is the predefined standard c function for printing output means if you want to print on the new line or if you wanted to print in the same line or if you just want to if you want to print the output or something so you can use the print f and it is the predefined standard c function for printing output predefined means that it is a function that is already written compiled and linked together with our program at the time of linking okay so we do not define the function body for the printf we just write the printf here and as you can see that in the double inverted comma that is written that i see i remember so in the output section uh the uh just read that in the output section it will be shown like i see i remember okay so the output is i see i remember so this is the sample program that is for printing the message okay so let's go to the uh say most important topic or the third topic that is related to the basic structure of program so as we know that what is the basic structure of program and the basic structure of program is as we know that c program can be viewed as a group of building blocks that is called function okay so there is a document section link section definition global declaration main function section and main function section contain two parts like declaration part executable part and this sub program section that is user defined function contains function one function to function n okay so as we know that okay so as we know that a function is an subroutine okay a function is a subroutine that may include one or more statement designed to perform a specific task means a function contain one or more statement that is generally used to perform a specific task okay so as you can see that the document what do you mean by document section the document section consists of a set of comment line giving the name of program the author the other details okay there are some variables that is used in more than one function such variable are called global variable and declared in the global declaration section okay and that is outside of all function because it's just outside of a function main okay every c program has one main function this section contain two parts declaration part and executable the declaration part declares all the variable that is used in the executable part okay so this is the very important point that is related to basic structure of program let's move on to executing of c program and executing of c program are just just in the fourth step that creating the program compiling the program linking the program function that are needed from the c library executing the program okay this is the complete diagram but i just take the my notes help because i just explained that is related to okay so as you can see that how we just developed this software in this c okay how we can develop the software in the c and what is the software development in this c okay so there isn't one important point that we have to just make the software in the binary language okay so as we understand that computer only understand the binary language 0 1 okay so there is an very important point that this is our source file okay it's not software okay so we have just written that we have to just file in the form of this term okay so the software file is just like use the extension of exe means exe file is the software another file is not software no other file is software but the exe dot exe file is the software because it contain the part in terms of 0 1 0 1 0 1 ok so as you can see that we have a c file okay so if we have a c file okay we just written the program in the c programming language and it is our source file it's not a software because os understand only dot exe file because operating system understand zero and one binary language okay and this is very important point that we have just write the code in the c language okay c language that is convert into software so we'll run the software so there is a preprocessor okay so what do you mean by preprocessor preprocessor means that the statement is tied with this uh so they are handled okay so they were handled to start this just like we just add the include studio io hashtag include stdio s okay stdio dot h so so the uh main important point that uh the statement start with the hashtag so they will be handled by the pro preprocessor okay and there is a header file okay there is a header file like stdio h i o stream dot h conio dot h okay so this is very important point that header file that is used to mix the content okay and that will make the new file that is called sum dot i file okay it will contain those part like include stdio h include the corneo dot h okay include i o stream dot because the header file contains because the header file contains some content that are used in the programming okay or that are used in the program okay after that we have a new file after mixing the content from preprocessor and header file that is called the sum dot i file okay in which th there is a hashtag statement after that there is a compiler this is not the program okay or this is not the software okay because the os understand only dot exe file okay so the compiler is the basically for the translate the program okay from as we know that it will translate the program from object file and compiler will translate one programming language into another and this is very important point that the compiler will convert or translate the program okay so it will it will just change the language and after that we have a sum dot object file okay object file for particular os means you have just used on the linux or in the windows or for the ios okay so after that there is a library file okay library file are those files that are that are not understood able by the object file okay and in which some content are not in the object file so it will be just come from the library file and there is a linker okay so we have just combined the object file plus library file and there is a linker and finally we got the sum dot exe file okay so it will be just for the sum dot exe file is just for the c uh executable file means dot exe file is the executable file okay so let's move on to the next part that is related to constant variable and data type okay so as we know that task of processing data is accomplished by executing a sequence of precious instruction that is called the program that is character set what is c tokens keyword identifier constant variable data type okay so as you can just learn from this pdf but there an one important point we have just uh go to a starting part okay so the next concept is what is identifier okay so there is a very important point that identifier just consider the three part that is constant variable and the key word okay so as we know that in the hindi in the hindi so there in english we just say that this is the word in hindi we call this and in the c language we just called the identifier okay in the english the word meaning uh the the meaning of the particular uh the meaning of the particular is that this is the word okay as we can see that so in the c language we just call that the identifier so as you can see that the identifier contains three part like constant variable and keyword okay so and the c language constraint instruction and the statement okay so the instruction are also generally for uh generally are three or four types as you can see that in the three type but the identifier can consist of constant variable and keyword then instruction and after that the program okay so what do you mean by constant okay if we make a software to manage information constant means any information in c or any information is c okay we have a data okay so in the data there is an information okay so it will be treated as constant so there are two type of generally constant that is primary constant secondary primaries integer real character secondary is array string pointer union structure okay so integer means okay integer as we know that what are the integers okay so as you can see that i just written in the hindi uh that bus point okay so this is just treated as integer and in the real there is a point okay so as you can see that if there is an point so it will be considered as real and as you can see that what do you mean by character okay so the character is that have the single code okay so the single code is generally called the character only one symbol okay and it will be not a character constant as you can see that this is the one and this is the two symbol and this if the single okay if the single uh code is generally used or the single inverted comma is used so it will be considered as character and string is group of character or the sequence of character so let's move on to the second part that is called the variable variable or the name of memory location where we store data okay so the rules of the variable are variable name is any of alphabet digit and underscored variable valid variable name can't start with the digit okay so the third part variable are just name of memory location where we store data just like we just stored the 20 part here 20 or 40 part here but what about the variables okay so we just use the variable okay so the third part is keyword keyword are the predefined word and these are the reserved word and there are 32 keywords in ncc that is like auto break go to if switch float okay so let's move on to the third topic or the third part that is called the instruction okay so in the english language we just say that the statement okay just like uh okay location go to school so this is the statement as we know that but in the c language we just said that this is the instruction so we have to follow that instruction so there are the four type that is data type okay data type instruction and after that there is the input output instruction and the third part is the other part okay so we i just i just add in that okay so second part is input output instruction the first is first is data type instruction it contains integer character flow double void okay so as you can see that declaration statement contain first data type okay so what do you mean by data type data type is the type of data we are just generally used for that like which type of data we are use that like integer character float double as we can see that we are just to read that what is integer real character float and double okay so this is the instruction and the second instruction is just that input output instruction okay so the standard input devices keyboard and standard output devices monitor and output instruction is screen for in uh they are printing on the screen and printf is not a keyword printf is predefined function okay after that there isn't some important point that what do you mean by new line character okay if you wanted to print your output in the next line so you can just use the new line character okay so and these are the some important notes that i cover that okay and in in input output instruction so how you take value from user so you can use the scanf scanf predefined function scanf is also generally not the keyword is can have just used for taking the value from the user okay what do you mean by format specifier and printf is just for the we have to print on screen okay and the scan f is just for taking the value okay so as you can see that i just made the two square number program and from the next in the next video we just talk about the operator part and from the next video we just also talk about this some important points or the important program because this is the basic part video okay so as you can see that what is the c token in the passage of individual word and punctuation marks are called token okay so the c token is just same that what are the keyword constraint identifier string operator special symbol this type of considered in the c token what is keyword and identifier what is constant you can see that what are the primitive data type a data type specifies the type of data that a variable can store such a integer floating character extra and there are the three primitive there are the three data type primitive derived user defined in the primitive section as you can see that integer signed and unsigned and there is a character point this is the primary data type and in the floating there is a flow double long double and the void okay so in this video we just discussed the starting part or the insta introduction part but from the next video we just completed the operator section or the control statement or the other if else for loop and the pointer and some of the important topics and after that we started the programming series i hope this video is useful for everyone if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section if you find the good content please like and share the video with your friends thanks for watching the video

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] hello hello good evening friends good evening to all of you we are waiting for five to ten minutes that candidates to join and after that we are just started the live session that is very important and infosys finally started on campus hiring for the four year in four year courses like for the 2022 batch and the 2022 batch on campus hiring is also started from info system okay so in this today's live session we discuss about all the points that is very important for infosys recruitment process okay so just wait for five to ten minutes and then we start this today's live session okay i think uh so many candidates joined today's live session let's start the video let's start the live session firstly i just share my screen with all of you okay so let me know that in the comment section my screen is visible or not my screen and am i properly audible or not let me know that in comment section then we start the today's live session okay friends and i will share all the related details how you can prepare what are the some important resources okay so let me know that in the comment section okay anyone okay yes visible yes yes yes start crosser okay thank you so much for confirming this type of mails are generally sent by infosystem that is related to hello thank you for participating in the infosys campus recruitment program we are confident that this program will open the door to new opportunities for you you have been shortlisted for the online test for specialist programmer and digital specialist engineer role under this program and we need additional detail from process your candy chair what these roles you have to kindly fill the application form before sunday july 25 okay so as you can see that this is the on-campus hiring this is not related to off-campus hiring if you are not from premier colleges or uh top colleges so you have to just wait for the off-campus recruitment but this is just on-campus recruitment you have to fill this application form and the first stage of the selection process for this role is infosys online test okay and whether they are the infosys comes to top premier colleges so they will send the mail to candidate so the first stage of selection process for this role is invoices online test it is a web protocol test that will assess your technical skills more detail about the online test will be shared you once you are shortlisted for the selection process after submitting the additional details before the due date okay so you have to fill the kindly fill out the application form and the first uh selection process for this role is invoices online test okay and once you fill all your details so you have to just you you have to shared uh they will share all the details of online test with you once you complete the application form and sanding okay so there is an important instruction for candidate to adhere the process to start preparing uh preparing for the test refer to infosys online test sample and prepare the guidance you may also watch the video for the equity to enforces campus recruitment program by their expert okay if for case of your query in case of any query you will contact your placement officer or write to us at talent acquisition at the infosys.com okay so this is the first mail that is related to important instruction for candidate that is participating in the infosys recruitment process it is mandatory that your college original id is available with during virtual interview because after completing the online test on the basis of your online test performance they will give you interview or the virtual interview opportunity in which they will check the behavioral skills as well as technical skills but there is some important point that uh the important point is that the online test marks is very important okay if your online online test marks is very good and you perform good in the online test so they will consider you for the virtual interview and they will send you invite for the virtual interview okay so this is just important instruction that you have to take the 10th 12th standard mark so what are the marks you have to calculate and if you follow some cgpa system so this type of okay so this is the ppt that is shared by infosystem and this is the propriety guidance means this is the preparation guidance and the spirit is not made by our team this is made by infosystem okay for the role of dsc and sp okay so the dse is digital specialist engineer as sp is a specialist programmer okay and i think the packages for the dac is five lp and for the sp packages is eight lpa like the power programmer post but this time this post name is specialist programmer friends if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section or ask in the live chat okay so the first point for the infos is that there is one important point that they share the test format in the infosys online test as you can see that okay so test usually contain three question that will you have to attempted in three hours okay means if there is a three question so the coding question is only ask okay the main important point is that they only mention that there is a three question that you will have to be attempted in the three hours okay test will have a sectional cut off as well as a total cut off okay means this section is important also the total cut off is also important because each question will belong to different difficulty level they will explain all the process in the easy a manner and the step-by-step manner as you can see that first is the easy second is the medium question third is the hard question so the easy content simple question that can be solved by the basic application of aptitude algorithm and data structure you have three question means there are three coding question you have to attempt in three hours there is a sectional cutoff also and the total cutoff also they will consider both cutoff okay and the medium question contains a usda question based on grady algorithm i said that so many time in the previous videos that data structures and algorithm is very important and you have to just read about and you have to learn and practice the concept that is relative to greedy algorithm and dynamic programming and the hard question contain usually a question based on dynamic programming so the test format is clearly understandable that there are the three question you have you will have to attempt it in the three hours okay easy medium hard and code can be written for each question using one of the programming language like c c plus plus java python javascript okay this is the type of languages that they written if i talk about difficulty of question medium okay so the this is the difficulty of question medium this is the difficulty of question hard and the easy question level is very simple question that you can solve by basic application like aptitude algorithm if i talk about difficulty of question medium so as you can see that what is the greedy algorithm what are the types of greedy algorithm they ask a coding question that is related because in the pattern they only said that there are three question that you have to be attempted in the three hours okay if i talk about difficulty of question hard so the characteristic of dynamic problem programming problem like following are the two main properties of problem they will uh they will okay so this type of questions are asked generally in the hard question and they will check all the coding skills that is mentioned that there are the two types of problem like overlapping sub problem and optimal sub structure properties okay so this type of generally uh this type of questions and this type of methods they generally ask and they mention that this is the difficulty of a question okay not uh they suggest that or not to say that this type of questions are come in exam but they only mention that this is the difficulty level okay as you can check that difficulty of question hard is just a simple some of the examples like knapsack problem fibonacci common sub string algorithm okay so as you can see that these are the some examples of dynamic programming that they generally ask in the infosys online test but they suggest okay but they just mentioned the difficulty of the question okay so if i talk about infosys virtual interview so after you complete your enforces online test and if you are selected for the invoices or a virtual interview so the round will assess your technical and behavioral skills total duration of the interview will be around one hour you must be you might be asked to solve a puzzle problem using programming language of your choice if you are from students from csit branch so these are the some topics that they be tested like algorithm data structure automata theory compiler these are the some important topics computer network computer organization operating system digital signal processing and object oriented programming if i talk about student from other branches so they will be tested like algorithm data structure computer network digital electronics mathematics object oriented programming and control system so this will be quite same in the case but uh these are some of the more topics in the csit branch so this is just related to infosys virtual interview so as you can see that they just mentioned the test pattern as well as the invoices online test plus enforces virtual interview information okay as you can see that okay so this is the some important that they just mentioned and as you can see that this is a sample of infosys online test there is a question that is given that these are the sample test one that there is a game based question okay as you can see that this is just related to while playing an rpg game you are assigned to complete one of the hardest quest in this game there are n monster so you have to implement this logic using a unique birthday gift you have to solve this type of questions very important because you have to practice dynamic programming problem greedy algorithm just to focus on the data structure section okay i just go to hacker earth hacker rank and you can choose so many platform there are so many platform and number of platform you can just check but if i talk about if i talk about so you can just you can just check the hacker rank platform and this is the very important as you can just practice the algorithm and the coding related section okay so this is the very important point that you have to prepare for the data structure and the algorithm section okay this is the part there are the algorithm question that is for available for the practice and you can choose a dynamic programming okay you can choose dynamic programming and this type of questions are generally asked like you have to solve this type of question very important and all these questions are related to dynamic programming okay there are so many and number of questions what the dynamic programming okay because they mention that they will ask the dynamic programming question in the hard level okay and they will ask a medium level like a greedy algorithm okay they they not mention the graph theory they just mentioned the data structure as an algorithm completely part for the infosys virtual interview not for the infosys online test but you have to prepare greedy algorithm as well as dynamic programming and some of the warm-up implementation string graph theory concept also because there is a sectional cut off as well as total cut off okay so this is the very important if you go to hacker or the website so there are the algorithm if you go to lead code website and if you go to code share so so there are so many n number of questions for the algorithm and data structure you can just take the question and just to solve all the question or some related question because this time if you are if you want to select for the higher packages and if you want to select it in forces for the dac role and the uh specialist programmer role so you have to pre you have to practice more coding question daily okay so i think this is very useful for all of you okay let if you have any doubt you can just ask in the live session i am waiting for your queries uh m tech student eligible i think m tech student eligible when will be for off campus okay if i talk about off-campus so the off-campus opportunity and fit you can hack within fees over but in the upcoming month if info system conduct again the off-campus opportunity will there be same exam for both the roles yes there is a same exam for both the role but on the basis of infosys online test infosys online test they will select you for the virtual interview and after performing in the virtual interview they will give you opportunity for the dac role or for the power programmer or the specialist programmer role expected date of this exam i think in the month of august how many questions should we solve for sp i think 2 to 2.5 question you have to solve for the specialist programmer what is the eligibility criteria 2022 b b tech all branches i think eligible m tech courses are also eligible uh but info system not mentioned that they will send it to mail to candidates okay uh sir how can apply shivam this is just related to on campus hiring what do if you want to apply for only higher package role okay so this is the option that is related to that okay if you just apply for the higher package role okay higher package role so there are the your performance are also considered in the infosys online test and they will check also again in the interview because they will give you higher role how much package are they are offering 5 lpa for the dac role and for the specialist programmer there is a 8 lpa package so i just explained all the details and all the points that is related to infosys online test and this type of mail are generally comes to a candidate for the campus recruitment process but if i talk about infosys off campus hiring so soon if they will hire the or through off campus so i will make the video for all of you when off campus placement is start in the upcoming month what about the marks criteria there is a sectional cut off plus overall cut off this is very important can you please suggest me how to prepare for the online test especially for the coding part for the coding part there are the so many platforms like hacker rank hacker or the code chef lead code you have to just solve the algorithm and data structure section and most important dynamic programming and greedy and all the concept that is related to data structures and algorithm because that they mention that okay they just mention or they just suggest that this topic are very important so you have to prepare and i uh in the live stream or in the in this live session i just discussed all the related point sir 2023 basketball there is an internship program for the some batches like you can check so many programs from the channel is there any extra time in exam for a person with disability abhishek i think no because they mentioned that if there is an extra time they will mention in the mail best site for preparing

you so much good morning good morning properly audible good morning friends good morning to all of you okay so we are just waiting for five minutes and then we start this today's live session we are waiting for candidates to join and this live session is very useful for all of you because as we know that code nation innovation lab 2022 batch hiring notification is out how you can prepare for that salary is 36 lakh per annum what are the some ctc advanced bonuses base package and other and the internship style fund is 1.5 lpa okay so the coordination innovation lab is generally work on the trending technology okay so okay so i think we start this today's live session thank you so much for joining and uh good morning to all of you started today's live session firstly this notification is generally for the uh currently for the on campus recruitment because most of the candidates suggest i talked to most of the candidate and they said that coordination is generally higher for the 2022 batch and this time they will hire through on campus but not to worry if you are not belonging from premium colleges so code nation is also hired through off-campus opportunity okay so let me uh let me just know that my screen is visible or not let me know that in the comment section where is the link for coordination i just explained all the things where uh how you can apply for this opportunity if this is on-campus opportunity so how you can apply for the off-campus opportunity okay so let me know that in the comment section that uh my screen is visible or not okay visible visible thank you so much for confirming okay so this is the code vision innovation uh coordination innovation labs website okay as you can see that this is the hiring pattern that they follow okay so the first point for the code nation okay i just take the previous website and the previous trend that they hire for the previous batches like for the previous year they hire the 21 batch 22 batch and the 23 batch okay so there is a one important point that as you can see that this is the hiring competition okay so it if you got an off-campus opportunity or for the coordination so you can apply for this opportunity there is no problem there is a good package and currently there is an on-campus opportunity for the freshers candidate for the batch okay if you just got the on-campus opportunity just apply for that there is no problem but if you are not belonging from premier colleges and coordination not visit your colleges so what about that so for that as you can see on the code nation website they run a coding challenge code again twice a year to shortlist candidates for the interview okay alternatively if we visit a campus the candidate are first made go through online tests it is understand if the candidate are above the bar where they can translate their thinking to code in a reasonable manner okay so as you can see that there are the two opportunities if they visit your campus so you can just go through the online test and after that interviews and uh some of the coding challenges okay but if you are not belonging from or if you are not belonging from premier colleges so you there is an opportunity for all of your 2022 bash like there is a coding challenge called the code again twice a year to shortlist candidate for the interview okay so the code again is portage on is as you can see that this is the competition that is conducted by code nation innovation lab and this is what the job profile for the software development engineer full time and internship if i talk about this is conducted in the 2020 year okay so as you can see that uh previous year they conducted the eligibility for the code sprint is open to all participation if you are from be beta cami m tech me mca ms dual degree m tech plus b tech phd you are eligible for that and if you are graduating 2021 and 2022 okay so this year they will be conducted for 22 and the 23 i think okay see this is the for the off-campus opportunity for the on-campus opportunity they just they send the mail for the 2022 batch and if they send the internship mail for the 23 best so this is the very good opportunity but as you can see that i just take the previous year trend that they will consider the graduating in 2020 21 so they will get the software development full-time engineer opportunity and for the 2022 back there is an internship opportunity okay so as you can see that on my screen that there is a win prices over 2 lakh and chance to get interview with code nation innovation lab for the position of software development engineer for 2020 and 21 graduating student okay so this time this role is for the 2022 batch and the software summer internship is for the 2023 batch okay so as we can see on the website that they will conduct this challenge twice a year to shortlist the candidate for the interview so i think this challenge uh previous year this is on the month of the september okay so we have just to wait for the september for conducting this competition through the off-campus opportunity okay so if you just receive the on-campus mail so there is a no problem okay if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section okay there is no problem okay so uh just if you just got the on campus opportunity so just give the exam there is no problem but if you're not from premier colleges so we have to wait till september and after that this challenge is organized and we have to apply for this opportunity as you can see that the first there are the three interview they will check for that okay if you make it through the online test you have move on to the first interview which is designed to assess your coding provers and the problem solving skills you are presented with some complex situation that need to be coded okay this seniority level okay as you can see that the first interview is generally for your coding and the problem solving skills and the second interview is to assess the depth of your concept and the initiative you have undertaken okay if you have been in turn in a form and believe that you have done some good work so there is a knowledge and the technologies that they check okay and the third interview is finally check your ability to consider a fuzzy problem statement into a solution okay you will be given a specified problem statement based on the world real scenario uh scenario and the you have to ask to build a solution for it okay if you for example just they give that if you had your own startup and had to build a solution like google maps so how would you go about it how would you an auto suggestion tool for an e-commerce website okay so this type of some interviews that they conduct there is an interview one two and the three okay so on the hiring event they just give the code as on 2020 because there is a no information okay if i talk about the 2022 batch hiring off-campus hiring for the software development engineer role so we have to just wait for the september and i think in the september month they will again conduct the code as one national white coding challenge and if you are not belonging from premier colleges so you are eligible for this opportunity that time okay if i talk about the prices so as you can see that there is a one lakh cash prizes plus cnil goodies second position of 50 000 cash and third position has 25 000 cash okay as you can see that this is the cash prizes but if i talk about job description so that uh that they uh previously mentioned so there is a compensation okay as you can see on my screen that compensation is 33.5 lakh per annum package the base is 24 lpa package and the one lakh is joining bonus one lakh is tu graduation bonus one lakh benefit four lakh tu benefits plus ten percent of base annual target bonus this is for the full-time opportunity okay so if you got an on-campus opportunity so just give that exam there is an online test and after that there is an interview okay so how to prepare for this coding competition because there is a only coding exam or the online test okay so you have to prepare just check on the some website that they mentioned the previous year coding question and you have to practice more coding question for selection and you have to just improve your coding skills plus as well as your project skills because there it there are the three interviews that they mention okay if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section what if is this company want to visit our campus okay so this is the challenge that is just conducted by the code innovation uh the code nation innovation labs team that is called the code as on 2020 and in the month of september in the upcoming month in september i think they will conduct the code as on 2021 for the 2022 and the 2023 batch okay so this is the 33.5 lpa full-time opportunity but if i talk about on the code nation website so they mention that okay they mentioned that what is the hiring philosophy and what is the hiring process they all they mention on the website okay as you can see that what they look for they look for strong coding abilities algorithm data structure problem solving skills okay as you can see that they just they just relate to that and there is a premium institute in the country they just actively seeking out computer science engineer who apply from that and as you can see that these are the some top premier institution that they will hire okay and if you are preparing for the up role so you have to just you have to just choose at least one programming language and master your command over it solve programming challenges on hacker rank you can get never enough of practice okay so this is just for the on campus hiring okay this is just for the on campus plus off campus hiring so this is the hiring philosophy they are just say that and as you can see on the hiring event they uh you can just select that and if you are just selected for the internship so in the on campus they just they just offer the 1.5 lpa package for the internship role but on the on campus opportunity there is an internship month is to uh two month duration and the stipend is 75 000 per month plus benefit and project is live project where you can see the impact of what you

So I am worried that the score of TCS NQT Oct 2020 will be considered for upcoming TCS Ninja Hiring 2022 or I am eligible to appear for the test for TCS Ninja Hiring 2022 again.

visible now cognizant on campus nc next 2022 batch update currently so many colleges receive the cognizant on campus gen c next role important update for the 2022 back so in the particular live session we discuss about cognizant all roles pattern syllabus package details schedule and the complete process okay if i talk about general introduction so we have to first understand what is gen c next exam pattern of exam all rules syllabus of gen c exam and other role what is the schedule and the packages okay so if i talk about gen c exam so the gen c is just the full form of short for generation cognizant okay in the world of id there are the databases structure programming familiarity so the gen c exam is just related to generation cognizant but as you can see on my screen that cognizant recruitment profile have some type of profile that is related to gen c gen c elevate gen c pro and gen c next okay so if i talk about gen c so as you can see that we have don't know notification for the gen c gen c pro and we have notification of gen c elevate also but we have no notification of gen c pro and gen c we have just notification of gen c next and gen c elevate so there are the different type of role that is offered by cognizant as you can see that gen c is the starting post or the entry level post in this there are the different role application analyst infrastructure engineer quality engineer and the package is for lpn skills required is no minimal programming expertise required if i talk about gen c elevate role so ml au developer big data developer cloud iot developer ctc is in between four lpa plus skill bonuses and skills required is foundation knowledge and programming and database skills there is one important point that if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section okay so i will just under let me complete the ppt first and then i have to move to your comments okay so if i talk about density pro also you can see that this is the package of 5.4 lpa and the role is sales for developer oracle solution developer product analyst developer and if i talk about gen c next position so the senior ai ml developer fully stack engineer advanced c and unix performance performance engineer iot engineer senior sales for developer and ctc is 6.5 lpa 6.75 lp and the skills required is advanced programming skills with full stack abilities so this is the all type of roles that comes in the cognizant exam but if i talk about gen c next hiring flow and hiring workflow and in the end month of july the exam for the agency next is schedule as you can see that on the registration page while registering select one role from the gen c next profile okay you have to select one role for the from the gen c next profile there is a round one of skill based assessment after that if you meet the gen c next cutoff score okay if you just clear this round or if you meet the gen c next cutoff score so there is a round two of technical and hr interview if you are selected for the there are the two possibility here as you can see that my cursor and as you can see that there are the two possibility after the technical or hr interview that is selected for the gen z next next and found suitable for gen c elevate okay as we as we can see that this is the chancy elevate roll and the packages is four four lpa plus skill bonuses okay so if if you meet a gen c elevate cut off okay if there is a round one in on the basis of round one result you have two opportunities like if you meet gen c next cutoff score so there is opportunity of technical plus hr interview for the round two and if you clear the interview so you have opportunity of gen z next if there is a no opportunity for the gen c next cutoff score if you meet the gen c elevate cut off so there is a position of gen c elevate interview queue and the interview is held between september means the results are declared in the upcoming month or in the some days but you but your interview is scheduled is in the september month okay if you are selected for that means there is an interview also called this is the interview queue technical plus hr interview and if you are selected so there is a position of gen c elevate okay so this is the gen c next hiring workflow if i talk about eligibility criterion is the student information mandatory documents for registration so if you are b beta cami m tech mca ms it students from 2022 batch cac ec tripoli it electronic study communication engineering information science so you are eligible for this uh this recruitment drive and this is a for premium colleges only okay because this is on campus hiring a student should possess constrict consistent academic record with 60 percentage was greater in 10th 12th diploma undergraduate and post graduation student with standing error or more than two year gap in education are not eligible okay means if you have a backlog you have no eligible and if you have more than two years of gap in education you are not eligible at the time of joining recruits should have an overall aggregate score of 60 percentage or greater aggregate for the student who have applied for revolution will be derived based on the initial score cgpa to percentage conversion will be considered as per university norm okay if i talk about the student information so there is a one important point that the mandatory documents for registration is the registration will link will be shared with the college tpo okay with the college gpa on student must scan and upload the below mentioned document into single pdf file registration you have to attach your resume with the passport size photograph college id card all academic documents and the government id proof okay so in the previous streams or in the previous video i generally say that please make the pdfs for the following documents because this is very important and this will required in all of the mncs like if the essential higher so pan card is the mandatory because the pen details they ask in the registration form if i talk about documents for the interview as you can see on my screen this is the document okay so the most important point that what is the skills based assessment if the questions are from programming or if the questions are from aptitude or the topics for that okay so let me know that if you have any comments so you can just uh just drop your query in the comment section if i talk about skill based assessment programming or aptitude topics for that so if i generally uh mention the uh if i just read the previous pattern for the cognizant so if i talk about skills based assessment so in the programming section they generally ask questions from data structures algorithm object oriented programming database management system and the particular programming languages because gen c next role is for the higher packages and if i talk about skills assessment so maybe they will be asked the questions of aptitude but this is not confirmed but in if i talk about the programming section so i think they will ask some of the programming question plus coding question but you have to wait for the confirmation that what they just asked in the skill based assessment if there is any information that is related to skill based assessment so i will surely inform all of you and just upload the video that is related to skill based assessment but i think they will just ask for the programming or the programming section because the programming is very important and they will hire for the gen c next role and this is the higher role okay if i talk about topics so data structure algorithm and some programming section okay dbms and you have to you have to learn all the subject and understand completely all the topics and there is a one important point that you have to prepare for interview also because if you just selected for the if you just made the chansey next cutoff score so you are eligible for the round two technical plus hr interview after that you will be selected for the gen c next role okay so this is the very important point if there is any information that is related to skill based assessment what are the question ask what is the previous trend i generally make the some new videos for all of you in the upcoming days but this is related to that okay so this is the complete pattern for the gen c next role and what is the working flow what are the packages okay so if you have any queries regarding any exam so you can ask on the on dmd on instagram we are regularly best work on your best for best content for all of you instagram id is this you can just drop your query in the ins on the instagram id okay so i hope uh this ppt is complete and uh let me just discuss all of your queries in the comment section if you find good content please like and share the video i am also okay when off-campus drive will happen so one off-campus drive will happen in upcoming month coding question i think the coding question they will ask next month cognizant gen c next test yes will they ask aptitude skill assessment may be but not

a technical test and the interviews okay if you are preparing for the analyst or summer internship role so the test is i think the same because they follow the same pattern and as on the website as on the official website they maintain this and they mention this okay so the aptitude test is on the 22nd august 2021 so as in the aptitude so there are the three parts like quantitative aptitude reasoning and the verbal reasoning and if i talk about technical tests so it will be held in the first week of october 2021 so the coding quantitative aptitude computer science mcq advanced programming and subjective and if you clear the aptitude test and the technical test so there is a last for last round that is called the interviews that is in the third week of october 2021 so this is the timelines so if i talk about test detail so what is the exam pattern we have to know about the aptitude test pattern as well as the technical test pattern okay so if i talk about aptitude test pattern so you can see that there are three parts like quantitative logical and verbal in the quantitative part it assess your number system ability arithmetic elementary statistics data interpretation if i talk about logical ability so the part is divided into three section where abstract reasoning diagrammatic representation logical reasoning comes and if i talk about verbal ability you will you have to got the comprehension and subject writing ability parts okay so if i talk about aptitude test pattern so i just mentioned the previous year test button that is uh follow for the 2021 batch okay so the test has seven section all section are mandatory this is the first test that i talk about aptitude pattern test pattern not the technical test button as you can see that hey location welcome to goldman sachs engineering campus hiring program aptitude test so the duration is 105 minutes and the number of question is 68 as you can see that the numerical computation have eight questions numerical reasoning have 12 comprehension of 10 question abstract reasoning have 12 question diagrammatic reasoning have 12 question and logical reasoning is 12 question and subjective have two question so this is the aptitude test pattern that the goldman says exams okay so if i talk about aptitude test pattern so there is a one important point that is very important that if you uh if your each mcq earner you five marks for correct answer means uh if you correct the answer to so the marks is so the marks awarded is the five and the minus two for incorrect answer this is the previous pattern that the follow because there is a negative marking also each subjective question carry 10 mark okay so the subjective questions contain some reading comprehension and other type of questions okay if i talk about syllabus for aptitude test so as on my screen you can see that this is the quantitative aptitude syllabus like the permutation combination time work probability number averages percentage profit loss equation time speed and distance ratio mixture mensuration partnerships and investment these are the most important topics for the quantitative aptitude section and this is the complete syllabus for aptitude test if i talk about logical reasoning so there are questions on series algorithm-based question diagrammatic puzzles visual reasoning coding decoding data arrangement data interpretation clocks calendar direction sense this type of generally questions and this is the complete syllabus for the logical reasoning if i talk about verbal ability syllabus so only reading comprehension questions are asked so this is the complete syllabus for the aptitude test pattern okay if i talk about the syllabus for technical tests so as you can see on my screen that there are the two sections uh there are the some four or five sections there is a coding quantitative aptitude computer science mcq competitive programming and the subjective okay so as you can see on my screen that in the coding section there is a one easy and one moderate questions and if i talk about quantitative aptitude mcq or the questions for the technical test so this is the topic for the quantitative aptitude if i talk about computer science mcq and the competitive programming and the subjective so in computer science mcq there is a question that is related to basic data structure object oriented programming operating system searching sorting graph algorithms algorithms and the question is on the advanced programming and the subjective okay so as you can see that this is the syllabus for the technical test first is aptitude test if you clear the aptitude test you will be invite in you will get the invitation or invited by goldman sachs team for the technical test so this is the complete syllabus for the technical test okay i just take these some resources from so many website because it is very important to ensure that this is the syllabus for the technical test and the aptitude test okay so how to prepare for goldman sachs exam resources strategy to crack exam aptitude test myth and you have to practice more if i talk about resources so indiabix website is very good for aptitude the solving question you can choose the rs agrawalsar book or the other books that you prefer and just follow the aptitude tips from so many youtube channel and just practice the previous year question soon in the upcoming video i just started i start the series for the goldman sachs preparation but if i talk about strategy to crack exam so if i talk about aptitude test level

हेलो हेलो एवरीवन आई एम लोकेश एंड वेलकम बैक टू माय चैनल दोस्तों आज की यह वीडियो टीचर्स एंड ब्यूटी इन थे प्रिपरेशन फेज़ इसमें मैं आपको रिटर्न पीडीएफ नोट्स प्रोवाइड करने वालों को सब्सक्राइब करें मैं आपको सबसे पहले ही इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट बता दूं कि यहां पर पाइथन प्रोग्रामिंग सीरीज होती है वह काफी हद तक उसमें टॉपिक है इसलिए जो मैंने विडियो पाइथन प्रोग्रामिंग सब्सक्राइब इस वीडियो में करूंगा कि टॉपिक है वह है यह टॉपिक चेंज कर सकता सब्सक्राइब करने का यह क्वेश्चन है कि यहां पर नेटवर्क प्रॉब्लम है वह यह है कि आप इस वीडियो को पोस्ट कर दी ढंग से नियुक्त तो यह वीडियो में आपको जितने भी एडवांस और वह भी कंपलीट हो गांव में पूरी सारी चीजें आपको पूरा चाहिए गठन प्रोग्रामिंग मैं आप क्या पढेंगे कितने टॉपिक है मैं टाइमस्टैंप को भी ऐड करने वालों जितने टॉपिक से डिक्शनरी इस ट्रिक जो श्रॉफ के टॉपिक से वह इस वीडियो में क्लियर हो जाएंगे तो आप सभी को यह वीडियो बहुत अच्छे से देखिए इसमें मैंने आपको जो भी समझाएं बहुत अच्छे से समझ भी MS Word सब्सक्राइब तो मैं आपको प्रोवाइड कर दूंगी तो आप इस वीडियो को आप देख सकते हैं कि कोई भी टॉपिक और आप मेरे चैनल को सबस्क्राइब की शुरुआत करते हैं तो आज के इस वीडियो में सबसे पहले हम यह देख लेते हैं उनके बारे में सब्सक्राइब किया था वह मैं आप सभी के साथ शेयर करूंगा और एल्गोरिथम्स इन डाटा स्ट्रक्चर के पोषण से उनको मैंने सब्सक्राइब करने को स्टार्ट करते हैं और देखते हैं सबसे पहले के बारे में जानते हैं कि में पॉपुलर शो करें टैग वैंड्रॉस हमने क्रिएट किया था और रिलीज किया था 1997 में वेब डेवलपमेंट सॉफ्टवेयर डेवलपमेंट मैथमेटिक्स सिस्टम स्क्रिप्टिंग के लिए यूज होती है पाइथन क्या करती है पाइथन सर्वर पर भी यूज होती है वेब एप्लीकेशंस बनाने के लिए डाटा बेस सिस्टम सभी हम कनेक्ट कर सकते हैं रीड कर सकते हैं मॉडिफाई कर सकते हैं फाइल्स अगर हम डाटा बेस सिस्टम से कनेक्ट करते हैं पाइथन को यूज करके हम जो बिग डाटा है उसको भी हैंडल कर सकते हैं और कांप्लेक्स मैथमेटिक्स को परफॉर्म कर सकते हैं पाइथन की सबसे बड़ी बात दोस्तों यह है कि हम एक्चुअली में पाइथन को क्यों यूज कर रहे हैं पाइथन डिफरेंट प्लेट फॉर्म पर व करती है जैसे कि विंडोज़ मैक और लिनक्स राज मेरी फैक्टर पाइथन का सिंपल से इंटैक्ट है ए सिमिलर टो थे इंग्लिश लैंग्वेज पाइथन का जो सिंटेक्स रहता है वह डेवलपर्स को फॉलो करता है कि वह कम लाइन का फोल्ड लिखें इसी के साथ-साथ जो दूसरी प्रोग्रामिंग लैंग्वेज है उसमें ज्यादा लाइन का कोड लिखना पड़ता है पाइथन कभी भी कंपाइलर पैट्रन नहीं होता है पैटर्न रन होता है इंटरप्रेटर से अब हम बैक इसका मतलब यह रहता है कि कोड जो रहता है वह एग्जीक्यूटर जाता है जैसे ही हम लिखते हैं जितना जल्दी एकजुट हो सकता है वह जाता है इसका मतलब यहां पर प्रोटोटाइपिंग जो रहती है वर्क हो जाती है पाइथन ऑब्जेक्ट ओरिएंटेड प्रोग्रामिंग लैंग्वेज है पर्स को म्यूट कर सकते प्रोसीजरल उस फंक्शनल और ऑब्जेक्ट ओरिएंटेड देश में अब बढ़ते हैं मेरे नोट्स की तरफ और देख लेते हैं कि पाइप पहला मैंने क्या बनाए थे नोट्स में दोस्तों सबसे पहले मैंने पाचन का बेसिक इंट्रोडक्शन पड़ा था उसमें मैंने एक बात तो यही समझाती कि पाइथन का जो कोड रहता है वह रन होता है लाइन बाय लाइन ऐसा नहीं यह कंपाइलर और इंटरप्रिटर का मेन डिफरेंट चाहिए आपको मैं पहले बता देता हूं कंपाइलर और इंटरप्रिटर का क्या काम है और मैं आपको पिंटरेस्ट पर लेकर चलता हूं एक चीज बता देता हूं यह कंपाइलर है यह इंटरप्रेटर है अब दोनों में डिफरेंस देख लेते हैं फर्स्ट डिफरेंस कंपाइलर और इंटरप्रिटर से ही चीज है कुछ नहीं करते हैं यह जो सोर्स कोड रहता है उसको मशीन कोर्ट में कंवर्ट करते हैं ठीक है तो यह आपको बात ध्यान रखने की यह भी कॉर्ड को कनवर्ट करता है यह भी कोड को कनवर्ट करता है थी हेलो दोस्तों अब इसके बाद सबसे बड़ी बात रहती है कि जो कंपाइलर रहता है मान लीजिए मैंने यहां पर लिखा कि यह रिकार्ड 214 बीच रिक्वेस्ट टू और मुझे ए प्लस बी को ऐड करवाना है और आउटपुट मेरा जो रहेगा वह सी में आसान हो जाना चाहिए इसकी वैल्यू रहेगी तो कंपाइलर जो रहेगा इस ऑपरेशन को ध्यान से देखिएगा तो कंपाइलर जो रहेगा ना दोस्तों वह क्या करेगा यहां पर ही वह सारा यह जो जितने भी इंस्ट्रक्शन है यह जो पूरा एक्सप्रेशन दिखाए उसको पूरा एग्जीक्यूट कर देगा एक ही बार में और इंटरप्रेटर है वह लाइन बाय लाइन पहले उसने माना यह की वैल्यू बनाई फिर भी की वैल्यू टिवाय फिर उसने एक प्लेट भी ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म करेंगी वन प्लस टू थ्री फिर सी में वैल्यू जो आई उसरी फिर उसको असाइन कर दिया सिम यहां पर असाइनमेंट ऑपरेटर है बीच में इंटरमीडिएट लाइन बाय लाइन व करता है माना कि कंपाइलर इंफेक्शन रहता है मेमोरी के टाइम्स में पर जो इंटरप्रेटर रहता है वह लाइन बाय लाइन ही कोड को रन करता है और कंपाइलर रहता है वह ज्यादा टाइम लेता है क्योंकि वह पूरे कोड को 108 एक साथ एग्जीक्यूट करता है और इंटरमीडिएट लाइन बाय लाइन करता है तो यह डिफरेंस है याद रखिएगा आगे भी काम आएगा इंटरव्यू में पूछ सकते हैं आपसे से ए पाइथन को अब मैंने आपको बता दिया पाइथन को क्यों यूज करते हैं हम नोट की तरफ बढ़ चलते हैं और यह देखिए पाइथन का को ट्रेन बाय रन लाइन होता है अब मैं आपको लाइन बाय लाइन रन होता है इसी के साथ-साथ जो जावा और सी प्लस प्लस आधार प्रोग्रामिंग लैंग्वेज है उसमें उपाय जो कोड रहता है वह किसी उनका कोई स्पेशल नेम रहता है स्पेशल मेथड रहती है जहां से वह स्टार्ट होते जैसे सी प्लस प्लस में मेन रहता है जवाब में क्लास बनती है तो वहां से वह स्टार्ट होते हैं लेकिन पाइथन का ऐसा नहीं है पाइथन अगर मुझे सिर्फ दो नंबर को ऐड करना यह पैटर्न का आईडियली है जहां पर यह रन होता है यह फेशियल है तो मुझे अगर दो नंबर को ऐड करना है तो मैंने बस सिंपली दो नंबर यहां पर लिखे मान लीजिए कि मैं एक ही वैल्यू टू दे देता हूं और भी व्यक्ति देता हूं तो इससे दोस्तों यह होगा कि यहां पर वैल्यू आसान हो जाएगी और अगर मुझे आगे भी कुछ ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म करने रहे तो मैं कर सकता हूं और सिंपली मुझे पैसा लिखना है कि यह प्लस बी दोस्तों जैसे ही में प्लस भी लिखूंगा और इंटर करूंगा तो इस साइड से मेरा यहां पर आंसर आ जाएगा आज मैं आपको इस चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि कैसे यह लाइन बाय लाइन रहेगी और है और यहां पर हमने हाथों-हाथ का हाथ आउटपुट देख रहा है यहां पर ना कोई मैन फंक्शन है ना यहां पर हमें कोई वेरिया बल्कि टाइप डिक्लेयर करने पड़े हैं कि एक ही यह जो है वोट इन ट्रिक टाइप का है या बी जो है वह टाइप का हम यहां पर यह बल्क टाइप भी नहीं पड़ रहे हैं क्योंकि वे पाकिस्तान में रहता है वह देख लेता है कि यहां पर अब टाइप कर लेता है जैसे यहां पर मैं तो आपको यह ध्यान रखें अब दोस्तों मैं आपको बताना चाहता हूं कि एक्चुअली में काफी सारे लोगों को और कैंडीडेट्स को एक दिक्कत रहती है और काफी सारे इंटरव्यू में यह क्वेश्चन पूछा गया है कि यह जो कि मुझे यहां पर अब जैसे कि मुझे प्रिंट करना है तो मैं सिंपल तो यहां पर हमने डायरेक्टर ने कुछ बताया नहीं तो इसका यह इंटेक्स होता है यह हमें जो भी लिखना है यह डबल जो यह पैकेट से इनके अंदर हम जो भी लिखेंगे जिसकी वैल्यू अगर हमने डिफाइन कर रखा है वह एग्जेक्ट इसका एडिट यहां पर प्रिंटर जाएगा तो प्रिंटर श्रेणी में चीज है क्या तो प्रिंट दोस्तों इस बिल्ट इन पाइथन लैंग्वेज का हमको इसको फिनिश टो इंपोर्ट और इंक्लूडेड फॉर लाइब्रेरी टू मेक यू फिट यह ऑटोमेटिकली रहता है built-in पार्ट रहता है पाइथन लैंग्वेज का इसी के साथ-साथ आपको यहां पर ध्यान रखना है कि यहां पर जो प्रिंट है यह एक बेल्ल पार्ट है आप अगर पूछ लिया जाएगी प्रिंटर क्या है ब्रिटेन पार्टी अगर हम ऐसा बोल देते कि कुछ भी चीज को प्रिंट करवाने के लिए काम आता है तो यह थोड़ा कम हो जाता है हम ऐसा बोल सकते रिटेंशन ब्रिटेन पार्ट आफ पाइथन एंड आईटी विल बे यूज्ड टो ब्रिंग समथिंग ऑन द स्क्रीन तो अब हम यह देख सकते हमें बस जैसे प्रिंट करना है तो यह प्रिंट हो जाएगा तो आपको यह बात अच्छे से ध्यान रखनी है अब दोस्तों मैं आपको एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं यहां पर और हमने पाइथन से रिलेटेड क्या लिखा था हमने पाइथन से रिलेटेड यही लिखा था कि यहां पर जो इंटरप्रेटर रहता है या जो फाइटिंग रहती है वह मतलब डिफिशिएंट रहती है इसे कर सक चाहिए बिल्कुल अच्छा इंटरप्रेटर सिस्टम है क्योंकि यहां पर हमको सामने के सामने आउटपुट मिल रहा है जैसे कि हम यहां पर मैं अगर कुछ ऑपरेशंस परफॉर्म कर रहा हूं तो मुझे डायरेक्ट यहां पर आउटपुट मिल रहा है अब इसी के साथ स्थल नीचे बढ़ते हैं और देख लेते हैं कि और आगे क्या चीज है अब दोस्तों मैं आपको यहां पर एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि पाइथन प्रोग्राम को हम कितने टाइप से रन कर सकते हैं जैसे कि मैंने यहां पर टॉपिक्स ऐड किया था कि आप पाइथन को हम कितने पाइथन प्रोग्राम कौन कितने टाइम से रन कर सकते हैं यह भी आपसे पूछा जा सकता है पर आपको बेसिकली ध्यान होना चाहिए अब आईडियली से कर सकते हैं यह जो आईडी के लिए आवेदन का शैल है इससे भी आप कर सकते हैं इसी के साथ आप कमेंट फ्रॉम से भी कर सकते हैं जो सीएमडी रहता है विंटर्स में कमेंट रोम से भी कर सकते हैं लिनक्स में भी जो दोस्तों इस टाइप से लिनक्स में रहता है उसमें भी आप पर रन कर सकते हैं जैसे यहां पर सीएम रहता है इसी के सब्सक्राइब पाइथन कमांड लाइन से भी कर सकते हैं पाइथन जो वर्जन होता है उसके साथ पाइथन कमांड लाइन भी आती है चलिए यहां पर दोस्तों जैसे यह साइड से यह पैटर्न की कमांड लाइन है तो यहां पर भी आप पाइथन के जो प्रोग्राम है उसको रन कर सकते हैं जैसे कि यहां पर साइड इफेक्ट नहीं ढंग की कमांड लाइन है तो यहां पर आपको पूरा उस टाइप से इससे जो है वह ऐड कर सकते हैं जैसे कि आप लंबी कर दूं तो यहां से यह में दिख जाएगा तो यह ढंग से कमांड लाइन सीएमडी अलग टाइप कर सकते हैं दोस्तों यहां पर एक चीज मैं आपको बताना चाहता हूं कि यह इसका मतलब क्या होता है यहां पर यह जो एरो दे रखा है यह हम इसे नहीं बोलते हैं हम इसे हम इसे बेसिकली क्या बोलते हैं कि यह इंटरएक्टिव दोस्तों में घृणा करता है कि हम इंटरएक्टिव में और हम इसको भी हम इस चैनल पर हम तो मोहम्मद ग्रेटर देन का साइन या लेनदेन का सामना बोलते हुए हम इसे इंटरएक्टिव पॉइंट बोलते हैं तो दोस्तों याद रखिएगा कि जब भी ऐसा लिखा है तो मतलब आप इंटरएक्टिव फ्रंट में और आगे क्रिएटिव स्टोरी है अब दोस्तों मैं आपको मॉड्यूल्स के बारे में बाद में बताऊंगा उससे पहले हम आपको मैं आपको यह बता देता हूं कि Idea ली जो रहता है वह थ्री की फैसिलिटी प्रोवाइड करता है पाइथन का आफ एक्सप्रेशन लिखना है और कोड लिख रहे हैं तो आप डाइरैक्टली रिजल्ट्स को यहीं के यहीं देख सकते हैं ना आपको कोई फाइल सेव करने की जरूरत है ना कुछ अब यह कह कर सकते हैं पाइथन में आपको अगर बनाना हो तो आप न्यू फाइल में जाकर भी फाइल को एकजुट कर सकते हैं सेव करके पर दोस्तों यहां पर सबसे बड़ी बात रहती एक कोड एडिटर रहता है जो कि प्रोवाइड करता है पाइथन का स्पेसिफिक कलर से इंटैक्ट और है लेकिन थे नेशन सपोर्ट अब दोस्तों यह इंडिकेशन क्या होता इंडेंटेशन का दोस्तों मतलब यह होता है कि जैसे मान लीजिए मैंने यहां पर लिखा एग्जैगरेटेड एंड भी और कॉल लर्न अब यहां पर मैंने लिख दिया कि क्विंटा एक यहां पर मैंने लिख दिया प्रिंट के हेल्थ प्रिंट बी तो दोस्तों इस टाइप से यह रहे का यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं कि आपके जो है एक ही वैल्यू यहां पर क्या 323 दोस्तों अब भी की वैल्यू के अतिथि तो ऑब्जेक्ट टू है वह क्या 372 क्या थ्री से बढ़ा है क्या दोस्तों मैंने यहां पर टू थ्री से बड़ा नहीं यह तो यह कंडीशन यह जो फेस है और इसके अंदर यह जो यहां से मैंने यह पूरा लिख रखा है दोस्तों यह जो मैं आपको थायराइड करके बता रहा हूं यह पूरा इसका ब्लाक के तो यहां पर कॉटन के बाद आपने है पर कुछ स्पेस देखी होगी तो यह इंडेंटेशन रहता है इंडेंटेशन मतलब जहां भी हम जो लिखते हैं नीचे उसके कुछ आगे स्पेस आ जाती है जिससे कि वह ब्लाक के बारे में पता चल सकता है कि यहां पर पूरा क्लॉक सेट अप सीएम हम कैसे लिखते थे इंटर मेन लिख रहा है उसी के नीचे सब कुछ लिख रहे प्रिंटेफ-स्कैनेफ सी आहट सी इन पर दोस्तों सबसे बड़ी बात रही थी अब यह जैसे ऑयल से तो यहां पर इंडिकेशन है तो यह इसका पूरा ब्लाक है तब क्लॉक की प्रिंट करने के लिए इंडिकेशन काम आती है पूरा अच्छे से पता चलता है पाइथन में इसका काफी यूज करेंगे तो इस टाइप से यहां पर यह फेल हो गया तो यह कंडीशन चल गई प्रिंट भी कर दो क्योंकि प्रिंट बड़ा अगर मतलब बड़ा है तो फ्री हो गई वैल्यू अब दोस्तों इसी के साथ-साथ पाइथन का जो इंटरप्रेटर रहता है उसकी सबसे खास यह बातें कि वहां पर घी बगैर रहता है जो कि यूज डिलीवर कर का दोस्तों यह यूज्ड है कि मान लीजिए हमारे कोर्ट में कुछ हेयर आ गई है यह हमारे कोड में जो बख्शा गए हैं या कुछ तो उनको आईडेंटिफाई करना और उनको छील कर देना जिससे कि हमारा जो कोड है वह इजिली इसको हथेली रन हो जाए काफी सारे कोड एडिटर है पाइथन के पास जाम हो गया इसी के साथ स्पाइडर हो गया एनाकोंडा हो गया जुपयटर नोटबुक हो गया वहां पर भी चला सकते हैं ऐसा कुछ नहीं है उनकी अलग फंक्शनैलिटीज है इंटरप्रेटर की अलग फंक्शनैलिटीज अब दोस्तों मैं आपको यह इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक जो है वह मैं बाद में बताऊंगा एक्सेप्ट वीडियो में की प्रोग्राम एग्जीक्यूशन क्या होता है पैटर्न में काफी सारे कैंडिडैट से इंटरव्यू में को पूछा जाता है कि एक्चुअली में बांट कंपाइलेशन क्या होता है डोंट नो इसी फाइल क्या होती है और मैं आपको बता दूं पाइथन की जो फाइल रहती है जिससे हम पाकिस्तान की फाइल को सेव करते हैं उसको डॉट पीलवा फाइल बोलते हैं तो उसका वह जो एक्सचेंजर रहता है कि जितने भी फैशन की फाइल रहती है वह उसी से होती है तो यह कंडीशन में आगे आपको एक चैप्टर नोट वीडियो में छोटी सी वीडियो बनाऊंगा 5 मिनट की लेकिन पांच है 3 मिनट की लेकिन उसमें पाइथन का आपको बताऊंगा कि बहुत ही जरूरी इंटरव्यू में मुझसे पूछा गया था अब दोस्तों मैं आपसे आगे बढ़ता हूं तो यहां पर मैं देख लेते हैं अपन की दोस्तों यहां पर हम सब देख लेते हैं कि किस टाइप से नेक्स्ट कंसेप्ट से तो दोस्तों नेक्स्ट अनुसार समझने से पहले दोस्तों मैं आपको यहां पर बताना चाहता हूं एक खंजर बता तुम बहुत ही इंट्रेस्टिंग ए अब दोस्तों यहां पर जैसे मान लीजिए कि मैंने कोड लिखा जैसे मैंने यहां पर एक ही जो वैल्यू है वह यहां पर मैंने काफी जरा कोड लिखे है जैसे कि एक ही वैल्यू है टू बी की वैल्यू है थ्रीलर फिर दोस्तों इसी के साथ फिर दैनिक आज टीके वैल्यू जो है फिर फिर मैंने रिकॉर्ड योर वैल्यूज हैव 5 अब दोस्तों यहां पर मैंने प्रिंट करवा दी एक मा बेटे को मशीन को मार दी अब इस साइड से मैंने वैल्यू प्रिंट करवा दी 2345 यह अब मैंने डेली क्लोज कर दिया जैसे मान लीजिए मैंने डिलीट कर दिया मैंने कंप्यूटर कर दिया अब मैं वापस आ जाता है तो मैं यहां पर कुछ लिखूंगा मैं चाहता हूं कि मेरी जो मैंने पहले तो यहां पर तो कुछ नहीं है यहां पर लिखा है तो अब मैं क्या करूं तो इस टाइप की प्रॉब्लम को सॉल्व करने के लिए आता है अब आते हैं सबसे पहले आप यहां पर जो भी लिखते हैं इसे बंद कर देते हैं सब जो है वह पूरा घृ वापस नहीं मिलने को खोल दो एक तरफ तो हमें काफी प्रॉब्लम होगी क्योंकि मान लीजिए कि अगर टेंट हाउस लाइन या वन नैक लाइन का कोड है तो हम कैसे लिखेंगे बार-बार बार-बार आकर हम इसे उस किस टाइप से इसे हम पूरा कर सकते तो उसके लिए हमारे पास एक तरफ साया जिसको मॉडल्स बोलते हैं अगर हमारे प्रोग्राम को हमें सेव करना है परमानेंटली तो हमको हमारे कोड को लिखना पड़ेगा फाइल्स में जिनको हम मौजूद भी बोलते हैं मॉड्यूल्स कुछ नहीं होता है सिंपली टेक्स्ट फाइल होती है पाइथन में इसी के सब्सक्राइब ऐसा भी बोल सकते हैं कि टेक्स्ट फाइल होती है पाइथन जिसमें पाइथन के स्टेटमेंट रहते हैं मॉड्यूल सिंपली टेक्स्ट फाइल रहती है पाइथन में जिसमें पाइथन के से स्टेटमेंट रहते हैं यह हम बोल सकते हैं कि पैटर्न के इस ट्रीटमेंट अ आप दोस्तों यहां पर मैं आपको इस चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि जैसे कि अब यह फाइल से अब यह फाइल आगे यहां पर पाइथन का इंटरप्रेटर का एक फीचर है कि मान लीजिए मैंने यहां पर लिख जाए रिक्वेस्ट दो तीन बीज और टू फॉर और मैंने इंटर करवा दिया एक ही वैल्यू एक आम आदमी की वैल्यू ठीक है दोस्तों अब मैं यहां पर प्रिंट करवा दी अब मैं अस्युम कर देता हूं तब मै सेव कर दूंगा तो यहां पर मैंने कर दिया लोकेश टू और स्पीड है वहां पर से वियर डोंट बिलीव आपको देने की जरूरत नहीं है ऑटोमेटिकली से हो जाता है अब यहां पर देख सकते हैं कि मेरी फाइल बन गई है लोकेश डॉट लोकेश टूट ही व्हाय अब मैं इसे जब भी रन करना चाहूंगा मान लीजिए मैं कंप्यूटर बंद कर दे तो आईडियली बंद कर देता हूं तो अभी मैं इस फाइल को यहां पर ओपन करके देख सकता हूं और मैं इसे रन कर सकता हूं जैसे ही मैं इसे ओपन करूंगा कभी मैं इसे रन करूंगा जैसे कि दोस्तों अब हम देख लेते हैं फाइल पर जाते हैं और हमारा इसे रन करते तो यह आउटपुट आ गया थ्री फोर आप यहां पर आउटपुट देख सकते हैं तो मैं आपको एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं यहां से कि आपने यहां पर फाइल सेव कर दीजिए उसके बाद आप कंप्यूटर बंद कीजिए कुछ भी कीजिए लैपटॉप बंद कीजिए अब वापस आ सकते हो इस फाइल को ओपन करके चला सकते हैं तो मॉडल्स का कैंसर भी कुछ स्पेसिफिक ही है आपको अगर प्रोग्राम को परमानेंटली सेव करना है तो आप अपना कोड जो है वह आपस में आ सकते हैं अब दोस्तों आपको एक बात बताना चाहता हूं काफी सारे मौजूद थे लाइब्रेरी मॉड्यूल है मैच मॉड्यूल हम आगे भी डिसाइड डिस्कस करेंगे डिफरेंट डिफरेंट ऑपरेशंस परफॉर्म करने के लिए अब दोस्तों यहां पर एक चीज आती है कि अगर मान लीजिए यहां पर हमारे पास पाइथन की स्क्रिप्ट हमारे पास पाइथन के स्क्रिप्ट है और अगर मुझे कुछ ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म करना है जैसे कि मैंने कुछ भी ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म करा और हम चाहते हैं यहां पर हमारी वैल्यू दिखे गायब न हो जाए तो उसके लिए मैं इनपुट का यूज कर सकते हैं या दोस्तों हम इनपुट का यूज जनरली इनपुट लेने के लिए भी यूज कर सकते हैं जैसे कि अगर मुझे इनपुट लेना है कि इंटर माय नेम तो दोस्तों इस साइड से अगर मुझे कुछ भी इनपुट लेना है तो वह बता देगा कि इंटर माय नेम मतलब मेरा नाम प्रिंट करो जिसमें लोगों से देखता हूं तो इस साइड से यहां पर लो कॉस्ट प्रिंट हो जाएगा तो इनपुट जो है वह इंट्रस्ट लेने के लिए काम आता है कि अगर आपको स्पेसिफिक के लिए कुछ इनपुट लेना है तो उसके लिए इनपुट काम आता है पर दोस्तों अगर यहां पर आप अगर डायरेक्टरी रिपोर्ट लिख देते हैं और यहां पर टू सो दोस्तों अब देख लेते हैं यहां पर कि हम इनपुट लिख रहे हैं लेकिन यहां पर कुछ इनवर्टेड कॉमा जैसा आ रहा है सिंगल इनवर्टेड कॉमा रहा है तो दोस्तों एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं यह जो इनपुट रहता है बाई डिफ़ॉल्ट अगर हम इसका अगर हम इसका भी टाइप देख लें तो यह टाइप जो रहती है वह ब्रिटेन फंक्शन और मेथड ए हमें यह पता है यह जो टाइप है अब यह टाइप से मैं क्या देख रहा हूं टाइप से हम यह देख सकते हैं कि जो हमारी पर्टिकुलर वैल्यू है वह किस टाइप की है जैसे मान लीजिए कि अगर मैं यहां पर लिख लेता हूं फिक्स मान लीजिए मैं यहां पर बीच की वैल्यू देता हूं सिक्स और मुझे अब टाइप मुझे पता करना है कि वे किस टाइप का मतलब एक कौन सा इसका डाटा पर या कि किस टाइप करता हम देखेंगे तो यह इंटक है मतलब यहां पर उन्होंने बताया कि क्लास इन टिका है तो इसी टाइप से आप ध्यान से उसे देखिए जब हम इनपुट ले रहे हैं या इनपुट कि हम दर हम कुछ भी देंगे यह कुछ भी जैसे मैं वैल्यू दे आज हम तो पता है दोस्तों यह जो वैल्यू रहेगी ना तो यह जो वैल्यू रहेगी यह हमेशा स्प्रिंग टाइप की रहेगी क्योंकि जैसे कि मान लीजिए मैं एक ही वैल्यू नो द में ML देता हूं कि आप इनपुट ले लो ठीक है दोस्तों यहां पर हम हम देख लेते हैं जैसे इंर्पोटेंट तो मान लीजिए मैंने डाल दिया सेवन अब मुझे टाइप देखना है एक का तुम्हें जैसे एक और टाइप देखूंगा तो यह स्क्रीन प्रिंट और है क्यों हिस्ट्री फ्रंट है दोस्तों जब तक यह तो इंट है 10 इंच यह ट्रिक नहीं है पर दोस्तों आपको बता ही कंसीडर करता है इसके लिए हमारे पास एक ऑप्शन है यहां पर लिखना पड़ेगा और हम यहां पर इनपुट दे देंगे तो यह सिंपली टाइप है यहां पर अगर हम लिखेंगे और अब हम टाइप करते हैं तो दोस्तों हमें मालूम पड़ जाएगा कि आप यहां पर देख सकते हैं कि यह जो है वह में रहता है तो यह बेसिक कंसेप्ट बहुत ही जरूरी दोस्तों यहां पर मैं आप आ जाना जाता हूं कि इंटरएक्टिव प्रोडक्ट के बारे में आपको बता दिया है किस टाइप से पाइथन के प्रोग्राम कैसे रन करना है आप पाचन के प्रोग्राम को बहुत इजीली रन कर सकते हैं अब पाइथन के इंडेंटेशन के बारे में आपको बता चुका हूं कि यह रेफर करता स्पेस एंड विनिंग फॉर्मूला इन पाइथन का जो इंडेंटेशन रहता है उसको यूज करके हम इंडिकेट करता अब क्लॉक ऑफ फूड यहां पर अगर आगे स्पेस है जैसे मैंने आपको बताया था यहां पर अगर आगे स्पेस है तो ब्लॉक आफ कोड जो रहता है वह रिप्रेजेंट करता है अब दोस्तों बढ़ते हैं वीर्य बल की तरफ अवेलेबल के लिए मैं आपको पहले बता देता हूं शायद में फोटो क्लिक करना भूल गया हूं यहां पर वेरिएबल का बाकी वेरिएबल का मैं आपको बता देता हूं एक बार हम नीचे चेक कर लेते हैं कि वेरिएबल के जो फोटो थे वह कहां से क्योंकि उसे फिर हमें हाथ तो दोस्तों यह फैमिली करना नहीं बोलो वेरिएबल का मतलब क्या होता है दोस्तों अब मैं एक चीज बता तो यहां पर जो भी चीज चल रही थी अभी जैसे कि यहां पर मैं सिर्फ अगर मैं यहां पर सिंगल लिख देता टू है और फ्री लिख देता तो सिर्फ कैरियर प्रिंट हो रही है अब दोस्तों अगर मुझे ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म करना है जैसे मी टू प्लस थ्री लिख देता हूं तो यह 354 है अब ऐसे ही मैं अगर कितने भी टू टू टू टू थ्री लिखते रहा हूं तो क्या मतलब है तो दोस्तों एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि जैसे हमें हमारे नाम आईडेंटिफाई किया जाता है तो जो वेरिएबल रहता है वह नेम रहता है मेमोरी लोकेशन का जहां पर हम डाटा को स्टोर करते हैं अब इसका क्या मतलब होता है जैसे मान लीजिए मैंने एक वेरिएबल बना यह नाम का यह मेरा वेरिएबल है मैंने इक्वल्स टू में लिख दिया टू तो हम यह आईडेंटिफाइड कर सकते हैं कि यह नाम का वेरिएबल और उसके अंदर वैल्यू जो है वह टू है तो वेरिएबल क्या होता है नेम रहता है मेमोरी लोकेशन काव्य भी स्टोर डाटा अब इसको वियरेबल क्यों बोलते हैं इसके दो कारण हैं पहला तो मेमोरी लोकेशन रहती है जहां पर डाटा इसको रहता है दूसरी यह चीज रहती है यहां पर दूसरी दोस्तों यह चीज रहती है कि नेम ऑफ मेमोरी लोकेशन व्हेयर भी स्टोर डाटा अब बाय वेरिएबल प्रोग्राम को समझने के लिए काम आता और इसी के साथ-साथ यह वैरी करता है मतलब वेरिएबल का मतलब यह रहता है कि यह कांटेस्ट नहीं रहता है यह चेंज होता रहता है जैसे मान लीजिए कि यहां पर मैं एक बहुत बड़ा प्रोग्राम बना रहे हो वन नैक लाइन है 100 का तो मुझे एक ही वैल्यू बार-बार चाहिए और मुझे चेंज करनी है कुछ ऑपरेशन पर भंग करने के लिए मैं एक ही व्यक्ति की सीख देता हूं यह की वैल्यू में कभी सेवन ढेरों ऐड दे देता हूं एक ही वैल्यू जो है वह मैंने भी दे देता हूं यह जीरो दे देता हूं तो फिर मैं जो एक ही वैल्यू है तो वह एक ही वैल्यू देखूंगा तो यहां पर एक ही वैल्यू लेटेस्ट प्रिंट होगी क्योंकि हमने एक वैल्यू यहां पर जीरो दो रखिए तो अब यहां पर कितनी एक ही वैल्यू चाहिए तो दोस्तों यह वैरी हो रहा है यह पॉइंट नहीं है कि एक ही व्यक्ति यदि तो सिर्फ दो-दो ही चलेगा आगे तक यह कांटेस्ट है अकाउंट नहीं है वैरी हो रहा है इसलिए इसको वेरिएबल बोलते हैं अब दोस्तों मैं आगे बढ़ना चाहता हूं यहां पर देख लेते हैं कि वेरिएबल के कुछ रूल्स एंड रेगुलेशन है आपको ध्यान रखना मैं यहां पर लिख रखें कि फर्स्ट लेटर जो है वह अंदर इसको हो सकता है इसी के सत्संग डिजिट नहीं हो सकता है जैसे कि लीजिए आप यहां पर अगर वेरिएबल को ऐसे लिखेंगे कि मान लीजिए मैंने वन इज इक्वल टू लिया नाइन तो अब यह क्या है दोस्तों सिंटेक्स एरर कन्नौट डिसाइड तो अगर आप यहां पर मींस अगर आप यहां पर जो है तो कोई दिक्कत नहीं है इंटर देते हैं और आप प्रिंट करवाते हैं तो यह भी के रूप में ही होता है और यहां पर मिल जाती है आप देख सकते हैं यहां पर तो दोस्तों आपको यहां पर ध्यान रखना है कि नहीं हो सकता है दोस्तों यहां पर कुछ पॉइंट्स देख लेते हैं जिसका नाम है और क्या होते हैं दोस्तों मतलब यह होता है कि डाटा जो कि हम किसी में दे रहे हैं कर रहे हैं जैसे मैंने सब्सक्राइब कर लें क्योंकि दोस्तों यहां पर जा रहा है लेबल में डाटा जा रहा है कौन पेट में डाटा जा रहा है तो लिटरल जो रहते हैं बेसिकली दो टाइप के रहते हैं काफी सारे टाइप के रहते हैं यहां पर नीचे जैसे कि न्यूमैरिक हो गए न्यूमैरिक में इंटर लॉन्ग फुट यह लिटरल्स है इस क्रीम हो गया बुलियन लेटरल होगा जैसे कि ट्रू फॉर स्पेशल डिटेल्स अब दोस्तों एक चीज बताना चाहता लेकिन सिर्फ खाली यही मतलब रहता है कि जो हम डाटा दे रहे हैं कि वे इस साइड से होते हैं और जो व्यक्ति को सबस्क्राइब नाउ फ्रेंड्स अब हम पढ़ते हैं इसके बारे में कितने ढ ढ ढ ढ ढ का मतलब होता है मतलब यह होता है जो कि जैसे कि यह तो इसको यूज कर सकता है फंक्शन के अंदर भी तो सकते हैं बाहर भी यूज़ ऑफ ग्लोबल एक्सेसिबल रहते हैं बाकी अगर इस फंक्शन के अंदर अगर आप सीरियल बनाएंगे दूसरा टाइप केवल होते लोकल वेरिएबल अब इसी के साथ मैं आपको बताना चाहता हूं कि यहां पर जैसे फंक्शन है इसके अंदर आपने एक ख्याल बनाए रिक्वेस्ट लोकेश तो यह क्या हो गया यह हो गया एक लोकल वेरिएबल क्योंकि यह सिर्फ इस फंक्शन के अंदर ही एक्टर सफल होगा बाहर नहीं होगा मान लीजिए कि यहां पर एक ग्लोबल वेरिएबल है जैसे कि यहां पर एक ग्लोबल वेरिएबल मैं आपको फ्रंट पर लेकर चलता हूं पूरा अच्छे से बताऊंगी किस टाइप से ग्लोबल और लोकल वेरिएबल एंड यहां पर एक वेरिएबल है एक्स कि कुछ वैल्यू है यहां पर फंक्शन है फिर यहां पर एक ही रिक्वेस्ट एक और तो दोस्तों यह तो यह भी हो सकता है संघ की पर सबसे बड़ी बात यह है कि यह लोग दोस्तों क्योंकि यहां पर जो यह है यह सिर्फ कि फंक्शन के अंदर यूज होगा मतलब यह बाहर यूज नहीं हो सकता है मान लीजिए कि इस फंक्शन को आपको यहां पर आप मान लीजिए कि यही वेरिएबल सेम नाम का वेरिएबल यहां पर यूज कर रहे हैं जैसे यहां पर भी मिक्स कर रहे हैं और यहां पर नेक्स्ट कर रहे लेकिन दोनों की डिफरेंट व्यर्थ है क्योंकि यह ग्लोबल है और यह लोकल वेरिएबल मान लीजिए इस ग्लोबल वेरिएबल को आपको ही फंक्शन के अंदर भी चलाना है इस फंक्शन के अंदर भी यूज करना है तो आप यहां पर ग्लोबल कीवर्ड का यूज कर सकते हैं क्योंकि यहां पर अगर सेम नाम से एक फंक्शन सेम नाम से दोनों वेरिएबल बन गए तो उनकी वैल्यू डिफर कैसे होगी क्योंकि यह वैल्यू तो वह मानती यही चलेगा कि इसकी वैल्यू तो पूरे इसकी तरह से हम है तो इस साइड से आपको यहां पर ध्यान रखना है कि जब भी हमें अगर किसी भी व्यक्ति लेबल वियरेबल को यूज करना है मान लीजिए कि हमें जो वैल्यू है उसको ग्लोबली इनसाइड भी करना है फंक्शन के तो ग्लोबल कीवर्ड के दो यूज होते हैं सबसे बड़ी बात फंक्शन के बाहर भी अगर हमें इस तो यूज करना है ग्लोबल यूज करना है तो हम ग्लोबल कीवर्ड का यूज कर सकते हैं इसी के साथ अगर वैल्यू चेंज करनी है बल्कि सिमिलर कोर्ट में तो उसके लिए भी हो सकता है जैसे मान लीजिए पर एक की वैल्यू बंदे रखी थी और यहां पर भी इसकी वैल्यू पर यंग ग्लोबल कि अगर यहां पर कुछ और होता तो फिर हम क्या समझते लोकल वेरिएबल तो फिर वह चेंज घृत कमेंट कमेंट क्या चीज होती है दोस्तों कमेंट का मतलब यह होता है कि कमेंट सब्सक्राइब कर लीजिए कि यहां पर मैंने हजार लाइन का अब कोई नया प्रोग्राम या फिर जो आपके टीम में वापसी के साथ काम करते हैं तो उनको कैसे पता चलेगा कि यह आपने इतना यहां तक कि आपने तो इसके लिए आप कमेंट का यूज कर सकते हैं थैंक्यू टेबल कभी भी नहीं होते हैं सबसे बड़ी बात यह रहती है कमेंट कि जिससे मान लीजिए मैंने आपको लोकेश के का तो यह लोकेश को प्रिंट नहीं करवाएगा अगर मैं सीधा ऐसा लिखूंगा तो यह दर्द देगा पर अगर मैं इसे कमेंट में लिखूंगा तो यहां पर ऐड नहीं देगा क्योंकि इसे स्किप कर देगा यह सिर्फ 344 के लिए यहां पढ़ सकते हैं या कुछ भी ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म करवाना जैसे अगर मान लीजिए आप एक प्लस भी करवाते हैं और उसके आगे कमेंट में डाल देते हैं कि एडिक्शन तो यहां से आप स्पेसिफिक कर सकते हैं यहां पर एडिशन हो रहा है दो नंबर का तो इस साइड से कमेंट का काम रहता है इसी वजह से दोस्तों मैं आपको यहां पर चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि ग्लोबल वेरिएबल के बारे में हमने पढ़ लिया है कि ऐसे वेरिएबल जो कि फंक्शन किया वेबसाइट क्रिएट होते हैं इनको यूज कर सकते हैं फंक्शन इंसाइड आफ आउटसाइड अब यहां पर नई चीज पड़ते हैं जिसका नाम है पाइथन keywords1 आइडेंटिफ़ायर आईडेंटिफायर के बाद पहले पड़ते हैं पहले कीवर्ड्स के बारे में जान लेते हैं स्टीवर्ट दोस्तों क्या होते हैं कि वर्ड्स कि इसे समझा जा रहा है कि कुछ कि यह मींस कीवर्ड्स हैं जिनसे म्यूनिख के लिए या अलग इनकी पहचान रहती है तो कीवर्ड्स का मतलब होता है रिजर्व्स वर्ड्स होते हैं इनको यूज करके हम डिफाइन करते सेंटेंस टो रिस्ट्रक्चर पाइथन लैंग्वेज का पति की वजह से और वह के सेंसिटिव हैं के सेंसिटिव दोस्तों ऐसा नहीं रहता है इसका मतलब के सेंसिटिव में यह मतलब नहीं रहता है कि वह मतलब का बड़े लेटेस्ट में भी है या लांच कैपिटल में भी है इस मामले में भी वह के सेंसिटिव है वह जैसे हैं वैसे ही है पर जतिन कीवर्ड है ट्रू फॉल्स और न उनको ऐसा का ऐसा ही लिखा जाता है जैसे कि लोअर केस में जैसे कि दे आर रिटन एस यूजुअल अदर आर्य के स्किन सेंसिटिव से यह मतलब है कि जितने भी पाइथन k33 कीवर्ड्स है वह सभी लोअर केस में है ठीक है दोस्तों पंजाब टू होल ऑन है जिससे यह थ्रू है तो ठीक कैपिटल कैपिटल इन थे कैपिटल है यहां पर तो इस टाइप से यह तीनों सेम लिखा जाता है बाकी सब लोअर केस में लिखे जाते हैं तो कीवर्ड्स कभी भी जो रहते हैं वह वेरिएबल नेम नहीं हो सकते हैं या वेरिएबल फंक्शन का नाम और आधार आईडेंटिफाई रूप में उन्हें ऐड नहीं कर सकते काफी सारे के लिए वड़े जैसे कि ट्रू फॉल्स इन थे यह सब कीवर्ड्स हैं अब आइडेंटिफायर्स होते हैं आईडेंटिफाइड दोस्तों आइडेंटिफ़ायर का क्या मतलब होता है आइडेंटिफ़ायर जो कि नाम रहते हैं इससे जो कि हमारे प्रोग्राम में यूज करते हैं जैसे कि वेरिएबल का नाम फंक्शन का नाम तो दोस्तों यह सब आईडेंटिफायर है क्योंकि नाम ही तो दे रहा है हम किसी को नेम दे रहे हैं अभी हमें भी हमारे किचन अ मतलब डिफाइन दिया जाता है यह में किससे यूनीकली आईडेंटिफाई किया जाता है हमारे नेम से कि इस प्रश्न का पर्टिकुलर यह नेम है तो उस टाइप सफेद 185 भी होते हैं पाइथन आईडेंटिफायर कि कुछ कंडीशन रहती है कि फर्स्ट लेटर कभी भी फुल लेटर या अंदर इसको फर्स्ट भी लेटर और अंडरटेकर हो सकता है डिजिट नहीं हो सकती है स्पेशल सिंबल भी यूज नहीं कर सकते हम और आईडेंटिफायर किसी भी लेंथ के और सकते हैं और कीवर्ड कभी भी आईडेंटिफाइड नहीं होते हैं जैसा कि मैंने आपको यहां पर पहले बता दे कि वह अलग चीज है तरफ बढ़ते हैं आपरेटर्स की तरफ अभी आपरेटर्स किस काम में आते हैं सबसे पहले अगर कुछ भी ऑपरेशंस परफॉर्म करवाना है हमें तो उसके लिए ऑपरेटर काम आते हैं मान लीजिए कि मैं यहां पर लिखता हूं थ्री प्लस फोर तो दोस्तों यहां पर आपको यहां पर बताऊं तो यह जो बीच में प्लस है इसको मॉडरेटर बोलते हैं और यह जो थ्री ओर फोर है या अप्रैल है और फ्रेंड्स मेरा यहां पर यह मतलब है कि इन दोनों यह जो है इसमें प्लस जो है वह ऑपरेटर है तो एडिशन सब्सट्रैक्शन मल्टीप्लिकेशन परफॉर्म करने के लिए यहां पर ऑपरेटर रहेगा और यहां पर यह दोनों प्रेम रहेंगे तो दोस्तों ऑपरेटर्स का मतलब आपको समझ आ गया होगा कि यह सिंबल जो रहते हैं जो कि यूज ओं थे कंप्यूटेशन के लिए अब मैं आपको बता दूं कि यहां पर कुछ टाइप से रहते हैं और फ्रेंड्स के बेसिस पर यह टू और फॉर ऑपरेशन से तो उनके बेसिस पर दो टाइप के ऑपरेटर रहते हैं कुनारी एक वाइनरी योग यूनानी में दोस्तों सिंगल ओपन रहता है इसी के साथ बायनरी ऑपरेटर में 2अपराह्न रहते हैं जैसे कि अगर यहां पर सिंह बिट्टू लिखा होता क्वीन मैरी होता और 2अप्रैल लिखित टू प्लस फॉर्म लिखा प्लस को थोड़ी सी प्लस को मत देखिए टूर फॉर को देखिए तो यह बायनरी ऑपरेटर ऑपरेटर के बेसिस पर काफी सारे ऑपरेटर रहते हैं अर्थमैटिक रिलेशनल मेंबरशिप के लिए एक-एक करके डिस्कस कर लेते हैं अब दोस्तों सबसे पहले चलते हैं अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेटर पर यहां पर यह कोई डाटा टाइप और यह सब गया है अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेटर के बारे में मैं आपको बताने वाला हूं हां ठीक है दोस्तों तो यह साइड से अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेटर आ गए अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेशंस अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेटर से ऑपरेटर रहते हैं जो कि बेसिकली अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेशंस परफॉर्म करते हैं जैसे कि मल्टिप्लिकेशन सब्सट्रैक्शन डिविजन ट्रंकिंग डिविजन प्रिंटिंग डिवीजन का मतलब दोस्तों यह रहता है फ्रंट कर देता है रिजल्ट को जैसे कि फर्स्ट पार्टी देता है जैसे मान लीजिए कि अगर मैं यहां पर ट्रंकिंग डिविजन का यूज करता हूं जैसे कि यह फॉर कोमा में मींस अ फॉर डिवाइड टू करता हूं तो मुझे टू मिल रहा है 2.0 मिल रहा है जहां पर देखिए फॉर मोर टो कम है रिमाइंड कराओ तो मुझे 2.0 मिल रहा है और अगर मैं यहां पर टन कटिंग डिविजन का यूज करूंगा तो मुझे टू वैल्यू मिलेगी तो दोस्तों यह ठंडी सेट कर देता है रिजल्ट तो यह पूरी वैल्यू नहीं बताता है यह सिगरेट कर देता है जड़ को आपको यहां पर ध्यान रखना है मल्टीप्लिकेशन डिविजन एंड पॉइंट्स इसमें हम पावर निकालते हैं इस टाइप के आपरेटर्स रहते हैं अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेटर सेकंड आपरेटर के बारे में मैं आपको बताने वाला हूं फास्ट ऑपरेटर अर्थमैटिक ऑपरेटर है सेकंड रिलेशनल है थर्ड मेंबर शिप ऑफ और तो बोल दिया ना अब रिलेशनल ऑपरेटर्स ईस्ट जो रहते हैं दोस्तों रिलेशनल ऑपरेटर्स ऐसे ऑपरेटर रहते हैं जिनको यूज करके हम कंपेयर करते हैं किसी वैल्यू उसको जैसे कि डबल इक्वल्स टो इक्वल्स को नॉट इक्वल टो ग्लास यौतूब स्कूल यूज करके देख सकते हैं दोस्तों अब बात करते हैं थर्ड मेंबर मेंबर शिप ऑपरेटर दोस्तों दो टाइप के रहते हैं और अब इग्नोर में दोस्तों क्या होता है नोटिस में यह होता है या तो जो इन मतलब इनका मतलब दोस्तों यह रहता है कि अगर मान लीजिए हमें ग्रुप ऑफ एलिमेंट्स में चेक करना है कि पर्टिकुलर अगर यह इसमें प्रेसिडेंट है कि नीचे मान लीजिए कि मेरे पास एक लिस्ट है मेरे पास एक लिस्ट प्ले लिस्ट डाटा स्ट्रक्चर है पाइथन का जैसे आपने अरे पढ़ रखा है उसी टाइप का है तो मान लीजिए कि यह लूट ली है मैंने और लीस्ट वन में मैंने कुछ वैल्यू दे दी वन फॉर्म टो को मथंन तो मैं यह लिख देता हूं और रिसेप्शन मैंने लिस्ट बना दी अब दोस्तों मुझे यहां पर देखना है कि लिस्ट में है कि नहीं वैल्यूज तो मैं लिख देता हूं फॉर आई इन लिस्ट अब देख लेते हैं कि लिस्ट में फॉर मान लीजिए कि मुझे लिस्ट में देखना है कि टू इन लिस्ट आप यहां पर देख लेते हैं तो यहां पर यह ऐसे नहीं होगा रन दोस्तों यहां पर अगर हमें करना है इसे रन तो अब यहां पर देखते यह साइड से इंटैक्ट सर अब मैं आपको फोर से चलाकर बता दूंगी फॉर टू इन मैं लेट थम देख लेते हैं और अगर हेयर तो प्रिंट करवा दो ट्रू नहीं तो प्रिंट करवा दो अब यहां पर सेंट अक्षरा है क्योंकि दोस्तों यह नहीं जान पा रहा है कि एक लिमिट टू है क्या क्योंकि हम ऐसा बोल सकते हैं कि फॉर अट लीस्ट वन हम देख सकते हैं कि लीस्ट वन इन अब हम देख सकते हैं कि लीस्ट वन में जैसे मान लीजिए कि मैं यहां पर कुछ मिल जाता हूं फॉर अ जैसे मैं यहां पर लिस्ट की कुछ वैल्यू से देता हूं फॉर वन टू थ्री लाइन लीस्ट वन क्योंकि हम यहां पर ऊपर डिजाइन कर रखा है लीस्ट वन तो अगर है तो प्रिंट कर दो जरूर तो दोस्तों यहां पर अगर प्रिंट आपको ट्रू लिखना है मैंने आपको बताया था ट्रू फॉर ऑल इस टाइप से एक ही वर्ड रहते हैं तो अगर जैसे हमें करना है तो अब देख लेते हैं दोस्तों कि यहां पर अभी भी यह सेंटेंस सरल बता रहा है यह दोस्तों में आपको बार-बार प्रोग्राम इसलिए चलाकर बता रहा हूं क्योंकि आपको यहां पर पता चल सके इंटर की एक फिल्म उसके पीछे कंसेप्ट क्या है अगर मां लीजिए मैं सिंपल वैल्यू दे देता हूं जैसे कि यह जो फर्स्ट टू मी टू देता हूं अब देखता हूं कि फॉर टू फॉर ए डे इन लिस्ट फॉर एड लिस्ट देख लेता हूं कि अगर लिस्ट में है कि नहीं है यह तो इस टाइप से तो प्रिंट करवा दूंगा मैं कि अब दोस्तों अब यहां पर ध्यान से दिखेगा यह अभी भी बता रहा है कि ऑब्जेक्टिव बल नहीं है जो कि वह समझ नहीं पा रहा है दोस्तों कि यहां पर इस साइड से लिस्ट में वैल्यू है कि नहीं तो आपको यह सारी ऐड से समझ आई होगी इससे आपको एक चीज याद रखनी है कि इन जो रहता है वह यह चेक करने के लिए रहता है कि ग्रुप ऑफ एलिमेंट मतलब पर्टिकुलर कोई लेस है या कोई भी चीज है तो उसमें ग्रुप ऑफ एलिमेंट कितने हैं और नॉट इन जो रहता है वह इसका रिवर्स रहता है बुलियन ऑपरेटर जो रहते हैं वह तीन टाइप के रहते हैं और तो टाइप और ऑपरेटर बुलियन ऑपरेटर एंड और नॉट एंड को यूज करके हम कंबाइन करते हैं स्टेटमेंट को एंड का सिंपल सा लॉजिक है जैसे कि मान लीजिए यहां पर मेरे पास है कि एक्सप्रेशन है जैसे मैं आपको एक्सप्रेशन पर ले चलता हूं और मैं आपको बता देता हूं कि यहां पर यह जो है एक ही वैल्यू में दे देता हूं नोट की वैल्यू में देता हूं 1948 देता हूं यह दे देता हूं तो इस साइड से यहां पर अगर मुझे चेक करना है कि ए ग्रेट डेन b&b थिस ग्रेट कर देंगे तो देखते हैं क्या वैल्यू प्रिंट करते फॉल्स तो दोस्तों यहां पर आप एंड ऑपरेटर का यूज समझ रहे होंगे यह किसी भी दो स्टेटमेंट को कंबाइन करने के लिए काम आता है जैसे यह स्टेटमेंट अलग यह स्टेटमेंट लगे तो इन दोनों को कंबाइंड करने के काम आ रहा है और नाइन जो है वह बड़ा है एट से तो नहीं यह थ्रू है मैं इस यह ऑयल से तो दोस्तों आपको यहां पर यह ध्यान रखना है कि जब भी एंड ऑपरेटर आए या एंड ऑपरेटर की कोई भी कंडीशन है तो सिर्फ आपको यहां पर याद रखना कि अगर एक भी कंडीशन फॉल्स हो गई बहुत सारों को होल्स मान लेगा मींस आगे वह चकित नहीं करेगा और फर्स्ट कंडीशन अगर फॉर्म कि ऑल स्कूल्स टो इट्स क्वाइट सर्किट इवोल्यूशन और लिबरलाइजेशन इसीलिए जो एंट्री ऑपरेटर रहता है उसको शॉर्ट सर्किट इवोल्यूशन भी बोलते एक कंडीशन जो गई तो यह उसका कोई मतलब नहीं हमने यहां पर अगर दोनों तो अगर दोनों और ऑपरेटर देख लेते हैं और ऑपरेटर का बेसिकली यह कम से कम करने के लिए काम आता है एंड और दोनों कम करने के लिए हैं पर इसका यह कंडीशन है कि अगर कंडीशन हो जाती है तो जैसे मान लीजिए कि मैं यही कंडीशन ले लेता हूं सेम यही कंडीशन ले लेता हूं और इसके बाद हम देख लेते हैं कि यह कंडीशन को करने जैसे यह ग्लास ढूंढ लेता हूं और मैं लेता हूं इसलिए मैंने यहां पर देखिए यहां पर आ गया है अब हम यहां पर चीज देखते हैं कि मेघनाद मतलब स्कूल कि यह वाला आप कंडीशन देखिए अगर एनी वन ऑफ कंडीशन ट्रू है तो आंसर जरूर आएगा जैसे कि पांच यहां पर जो है वह लेस देने से तो यह क्या या टू आया और फाइव फिजिकल टू ग्रेट अर्जेंट रिक्वेस्ट रिक्वेस्ट तो यह भी थ्रू है तो यह थ्रू हो गई तो यहां पर एक भी कंडीशनर होती है तो आंसर थ्रू हो जाता है और मैं आपको यहां पर यह ध्यान रखना है अब दोस्तों नोट ऑपरेटर का बेसिकली यही यूज रहता है कि यहां पर अब मैं आपको एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि मेंबरशिप ऑपरेटर के बारे में जैसे मैंने आपको बताया तो मैं एक चीज आपको और बता देता हूं कि मान लीजिए मुझे मेंबरशिप ऑपरेटर को चेक करना है कि इनका क्या यूज होता है जैसे मैंने ही नंबर लिया पांच इन अब मैं चेक करता हूं कि पांच क्या लिस्ट में है कि नहीं तो इस साइड से हम देख लेते हैं अब यह देख लेते हैं और ट्रू आ गया तो यहां से इनका काम आपको समझ आ गया होगा अब यहां पर की सारी एक्सरसाइज उसके बाद अपने हमको जाकर समझ आया है कि यहां पर इनका क्या मतलब होता है जैसे फाइल है तो हम चेक कर रही थी यह इसमें प्रेस कि नहीं है तो अगर प्रेसिडेंट है तू आ गया नहीं प्रेसिडेंट करो फोन सा जाता अब दोस्तों नॉट इन का मतलब यह है कि अगर प्रेसिडेंट है तो आंसर फॉर जाएगा अगर नहीं प्रेजेंटेड टो आंसर टो आएगा अब यहां पर यह बुलियन ऑपरेटर जो रहता है प्लेन ऑपरेटर का थर्ड टाइप पहला टाइम में आपको बता ऐड डाल दो थर्ड टाइप रहता है वह नोट रहता है मान लीजिए ट्रू है मान लीजिए एक ही वैल्यू जो है वह नाइन है और बेटी की वैल्यू जो है वह जीरो है और मान लीजिए मैंने लिख गया कि बेवफा मैंने लिख दिया कि एग सी इज इक्वल टू ए ग्रेट कर देंगे तो यह कंडीशन क्या अब मैंने मान लीजिए मुझे सीख या प्रिंट करवाना है तो मैं डायरेक्ट सिंह लिखूंगा और यह थ्रू आ गई यह टू है तो अगर मुझे ऐसे उल्टा करना है तो मैं नोट में लिख दूंगा सी ई एम नॉट में सी लिखूंगा तो कंडीशन फेल हो जाएगी रिवर्स कर देता है यह ट्रीटमेंट को तो आपको यहां पर ध्यान रखना आउट को तो आप दोस्तों यहां पर हमने अर्थमैटिक पड़ी है रिलेशनल पर लिए और यहां पर हमने काफी सारे ऑपरेटर लिए हैं अब हम मैं आपको सिलेक्शन कंट्रोल स्टेटमेंट और यह सब के बारे में तो इंटरएक्टिव कंट्रोल सिलेक्शन कंट्रोल इस टाइप से यहां पर आपको प्रेसिडेंसी के बारे में मुझे बताना मैं ही बता देता हूं आपको प्रेसिडेंट का मतलब होता है प्रेसिडेंट का मतलब यह है कि जिस ऑपरेटर की रोटी रहती है वह पहले मल्टीपल कंडीशन में जैसे कि अगर हम basic तरीके से करें तो दोस्तों इसमें क्या होगा कि यह हमारा यहां पर यह जो है वह Bigg Boss की सब्सक्राइब कीजिए जो की यू के में डिवाइड डिविजन क्लर्क प्लस माइनस ए ग्रेटर थन ओर इक्वल टू तक इस टाइप से यह जो ऋतिक शिफ्ट ऑपरेटर रहते हैं बिटवा इज और एक्स और लॉजिकल एंड इस फिल्म से उनकी प्रायॉरिटी रहती है तो यहां पर जो प्रायरिटी है इसमें उसमें सबसे बड़ी प्रायोरिटी किसकी है मल्टिप्लाई है क्योंकि प्लस की तरह की बाद में यहां पर टेबल से आप देख सकते हैं इस टेबल को याद रखिए का यह बहुत काम आने वाली है तो इसका f5 * 420 हो जाएगा फिर प्लेट चलेगा तो इंच प्लस ट्वेंटी-20 इसका करेक्ट आंसर टो मीट ऊ है तो आपको यह ध्यान रखना है कि अब दोस्तों हम नीचे पड़ते हैं और अब हम देख लेते हैं कि किस टाइप से हमारा जो है वह नेक्स्ट टू है अब दोस्तों यहां पर मैं आपको बताना चाहता हूं कुछ अलग चीज इफ्त स्टैटमेंट यह स्टेटमेंट मेज़र अब हम यह पड़ते हैं कि सिलेक्शन कंट्रोल स्टेटमेंट रिलेटिव कंट्रोल स्टेटमेंट का हम यूज करते हैं दोस्तों इस ग्राफ को आप ध्यान से देखिए और कंट्रोल स्ट्रक्चर कंट्रोल सब्सक्राइब हम यह सब्सक्राइब यहीं रहता है कि किस ऑर्डर में हमारा जो प्रोग्राम है वह एग्जिक्यूटिव ऑफिसर जैसे अगर कंट्रोल स्ट्रक्चर इन थे सिलेक्शन पैनल के बाद आपको तो क्वेश्चन मतलब सीक्वेंस जैसे कि यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं कि यह 90 पर फोन करें यह पर अगर हम किसी चीज की बात करें जैसे कि सिलेक्शन सिलेक्शन में हमें यह बताना रहेगा कि यह कंडीशन ट्रू है यह कंडीशन कॉल से अगर यह कंडीशन चलती है तो टू नहीं तो यह कंडीशन मिलती है तो फॉल्स तो इस साइड से फैल स्टेटमेंट एप्स ट्रीटमेंट मल्टी वे सिलेक्शन यह सब सिलेक्शन में आते हैं विडियो में दोस्तों यह रहता है कि अगर मल्टीपल कंडीशन चेक करनी है यह से करनी है कि यहां पर हमें बहुत बार व्यवस्था है तो उसके लिए हम यूज करते गुप्ता जिसमें वालों को फॉलो पाते तो कंट्रोल स्ट्रक्चर के बारे में ध्यान रखिएगा इस टाइप से होते हैं फर्स्ट कंट्रोल स्ट्रक्चर है सीक्वेंस प्योर सीक्वेंस चल बता चुका हूं बढ़ते हैं सिलेक्शन कंट्रोल स्टेटमेंट की तरफ जो कि तीन टाइप के होते हैं जिसमें आपको यहां पर सेलेक्ट करना पड़ता है इसलिए एक्टिव पार्ट इन ए स्टेटमेंट यह स्टेटमेंट बहुत ही सिंपल है जब हमारे पास 234 रहती है और अगर हमको एक कौआ इसको चूज करना है यहां यह 24 टू है तो इसका ऑपरेशन परफॉर्म और है यह ट्रू है दूसरी सॉर्स फाइल से तो यह इस ऐज के अंदर आएगा अगर यह नहीं चला फैसला यह बिल्कुल नहीं चला था से चल जाएगा तो यह याद रखना है यह स्टेटमेंट सिर्फ एक स्टेटमेंट का खाली यह मतलब रहता है दोस्तों कि अगर हमको सिर्फ एक ही कंडीशन चेक करनी है कि हमें सिर्फ यही कंडीशन चेक करनी है तो वह कंडीशन थ्रू है तो हम इसका यूज करते हैं तो दोस्तों यहां पर जैसे कि एग्स का आप देख सकते हैं कि जैसे अगर मैं फैंस की बात करूं तो डिफिकल्ट सुबह कर दूंगा और मैं इसे यहां पर प्रिंट करवा दूंगी अब मुझे एक वैल्यू देखनी है यहां पर ध्यान से 19 2009 अगर यहां पर अगर मान लीजिए कि मुझे नहीं करना है अगर मां लीजिए कि मुझे देखना है कि कि अगर बड़ा तो ब्लूप्रिंट कर दो अगर नहीं तो प्रिंट कर दो जैसे कि युवा सब्सक्राइब करें यहां पर सब्सक्राइब करें रुकिए टिप लक चल जाएगा तो इस टाइप का आपको ध्यान रखना है और दोस्तों मल्टी वे सिलेक्शन में नेक्स्ट यह आता है मल्टीप्ल स्टेटमेंट में तीन ए गवर्नमेंट मल्टी हुए दो टाइप करते हैं नेक्स्ट इसमें दोस्तों यह होता है कि स्टेटमेंट के अंदर स्टेटमेंट रहता है अगर यह एक कंडीशन है वह हो जाती है तो फिर चेक करेंगे तो अगर हम को एकजुट करना घृिणत इसको यूज कर सकते हैं अब बात करते हैं कि यह क्या होता है दोस्तों यह मतलब कि मैंने कंडीशन चेक करें और सब्सक्राइब कर चेक करना है एक कंडीशन में यूज करूंगा लेकिन अगर मल्टीपल कंडीशन तो मैं यूज करूंगा मैं यह लीजिए यह नहीं चला यह चलेगा इसलिए यह चलेगा और अगर यह दोनों पैरों नहीं चले तो फिर में ऐसे तो इस साइड से लेफ्ट का मतलब होता है लिफ्ट का मतलब यही होता है l सिर्फ और सिर्फ लेफ्ट एस लैटर तो इस साइड से पूरी सीधी रहती है यह लैटर रहता है अब दोस्तों हम बढ़ते हैं इंटरएक्टिव कंट्रोल स्टेटमेंट की तरफ मोर देख लेते हैं काफी सारे नोट्स में टॉपिक है आप उन्हें रिपोर्ट कर सकते हैं रिलेटिव में सबसे पहले रूप में आता है वह लुट-लुट का सबसे पहला मतलब यहीं रहता है वह लुक जिंदगी भर याद रखने के लिए एक ही बात याद रखिएगा कि जब तक आपको कंडीशन थ्रू करवानी है जब तक कंडीशन ट्रू है तब तक आप क्वाइलों चलेगा बिलों का सिम्टम्स बहुत ही सिंपल है जैसे कि कंडीशन और स्टेटमेंट तो फाइलों व मान लीजिए अकाउंट की वैल्यू वन है क्वांटम आफ वेरिएबल है उसकी वैल्यू वन है काउंटर यह देख रहा है कि लाइव डेमो रिक्वेस्ट प्रोफाइल जब काउंटर लड्डू रिक्वेस्ट 254 जाएगा तो जब तक यह टू रहेगा जैसे अकाउंट यहां पर बनाया तो वन इस लेनदेन रिक्वेस्ट उपाय क्वेश्चन है यह पहले दिन * यह कंडीशन तो अकाउंट प्रिंट कर दो अकाउंट को वन से बढ़ा दो फिर अकाउंट यहां पर गया प्रॉफिट हुआ गया तो आने के बाद वापस प्रूफ तो इस टाइम से यह पूरी कंडीशन चलती रहेगी तो दोस्तों जब तक बॉईल लोग तभी चलता है वह लुक काम तब जब यूज कर सकते हैं जब हमें s4s कंडीशन को ट्रू करवाना हो अब नेक्स्ट हम चलते हैं फॉर लोग पर और फॉर लूप में हम देख लेते हैं यह कुंए में फॉर लोग क्या है फॉर लूप का यूज करके अट्रैक्टिव कंट्रोल स्टेटमेंट दोस्तों दो टाइप के होते फॉर लूप होता है और कंट्रोल स्ट्रक्चर दो टाइप के होते हैं और लूप होता है और एक वैल्यू होता तो वह लोग बता दिया और लौंग का मतलब यह रहता है कि अगर हमें रिपीट करवाना हो सीक्वेंस में सीक्वेंस का क्या मतलब है जैसे कि सीक्वेंस में दोस्तों मैंने आपको और डाटा स्ट्रक्चर्स के बारे में बताया पाइथन के अभी आगे भी हम डिस्कस करने वाले हैं तो लिस्ट पल डिशनरी सेट इस टाइप से डाटा स्ट्रक्चर्स होते हैं पाकिस्तान के तो मान लीजिए कि जैसे मान लीजिए मैंने एक वायल कंडीशन देखिए मैंने एक ही वैल्यू delhi-94 मैंने यहां पर लिख दिया कि वह ऑयल ऑलिव ऑयल एगो जय लेनो रिक्वेस्ट ऊ नो तो मुझे क्या करना है दोस्तों कि मुझे प्रिंट करवाना है हे गए और सिर्फ मेरा यह एक बार प्रिंट होगा और MS Word दूंगा यह प्लस बाद अब दोस्तों देखते हैं वैल्यू के इस साइड से जारी अब दोस्तों ध्यान से देखिएगा यहां पर जो वैल्यू है वह मैंने यहां पर डायरेक्ट प्रिंट करवा दिए एक उन्हें बड़ा यह तो यह फाइल उस जब तक कंडीशन करोगी तब तक यह वॉइस करेगा क्योंकि यहां पर जैसे एक ही व्यक्ति है मैंने यहां पर प्रिंट करवा दी नाइन करवा दी तो इसमें यह चली गई वैल्यू उठते ही नहीं है दोस्तों क्योंकि यहां पर नहीं चलेंगे तो नाइन प्लस 110 होगी यह कंडीशन फेल हो गई उसमें बाहर फैंक दिया आप अगर मान लीजिए मैं पर फॉर लोग का यूज करता जैसे कि मैंने एक ही वैल्यू मेरे पास टाइम है जैसे हम चेक कर लेते एक ही वैल्यू मतलब क्या है अभी टाइम है हमारे पास अभी दोस्तों क्योंकि यहां पर वैल्यू चेंज हो चुकी है वैल्यू नहीं है साइन हो गई है तो हम इसे अभी ठीक है हम चैन नहीं देते हैं मान लीजिए मैंने चेक करा कि फॉर ऑल कि इस ग्रेटेड 1012 ठीक है दोस्तों मैंने यह चेक कर लिया तो यह सेंटेंस सारे इस टाइप से कभी भी फॉलो एग्जीक्यूट नहीं होता है क्योंकि फॉर लोग है कि जो रहता है सेंटेंस रहता है और का सेंटेंस मैं आपको बताऊं तो फॉर वेरिएबल इन सीक्वेंस फॉर ऐसे ही चेक होता है दोस्तों कि फॉर अगर मान लीजिए वेरिएबल इन यहां पर कीवर्ड इस साइड से इसका सेंटेंस रहता है कि मान लीजिए मुझे एक नंबर चेक करना है कि पांच जो है वह इस लिस्ट में प्रेसिडेंट है कि नहीं जिसे टू थ्री 65 इसमें प्रेसिडेंट है कि तो यहां पर सेंटेंस अराध्या क्योंकि दोस्तों यहां पर मैंने गलती कर दी यहां पर मैंने इनवर्टेड कॉमा नहीं मिनट यहां पर मैंने सेमीकलन नहीं लगाया इस पर सेंटेंस है तो यहां पर प्रिंट कर दीजिए यस यहां पर प्रिंट कर दीजिए यह अगर है तो नहीं तो तो दोस्तों यहां पर आप ध्यान से देखें अब यहां पर आपको फाइव को नहीं समझ पा रहा है कि एक चीज है क्या क्योंकि अगर हम डायरेक्ट लिखते तो वह नहीं समझ पाता तो यहां पर अगर हम वैल्यू दे देंगे कि आई की वैल्यू जो है वह पांच है यहां पर मैं ही ढूंढ लेता हूं और दे देता हूं और मैं लिख देता हूं फॉर हाई इन पर आई नुव्वु कोमा 5 अब दोस्तों फॉर इन थे फॉर्म आफ ए चर्च में सजा देता हूं और मैं लिख देता हूं कि प्रिंट आइए अब देखिए दोस्तों यहां पर ध्यान से देखिए यहां पर एक लिए यहां पर ध्यान से की है दोस्तों 5.1 अधिक तो दोस्तों तो प्रिंट करना है तो सब्सक्राइब तो दोस्तों अगर हम करवाना ओर लुक को यह मैं लिटरेट करवाने उसी के अंदर काफी सारी मल्टीपल सीक्वेंस में चलाना है तो हम और लौंग का यूज करते हैं जैसे कि आप यहां पर देख सकते हैं रूट्स की वैल्यू है एप्पल बोर बनाना अब हमें यह देखना है कि फॉर एक्स मतलब एक ही मतलब है कोई वेरिया है वह रूट्स में है कि नहीं है और प्रिंट करवा देना है एक्स तो जो भी वैल्यूज रहेगी फ्रूट्स कि एप्पल बोर बनाना वह सब आ जाएगी यहां पर इसमें मींस एप्पल बनाना चेरी यहां पर एक वैल्यू और रहेगी चेरी तो इस साइड से आपको याद रखना है अब दोस्तों देख लेते हैं कि यहां पर जो एक फंक्शन होता है वह फंक्शन का नाम है दोस्तों लूब्रिकेटिंग स्टेटमेंट के बारे में आपको बता दूं लुक भी दोस्तों ऑल उसमें नेस्टेड लूप भी रहता है नेस्टेड लूप का मतलब यह रहता है यह लूप के अंदर एक लोग मान लीजिए यह फर्स्ट लुप्त हो रही है किन्नर लूपर तो यह इस टाइप से कंडीशन चलती है पांच स्टेटमेंट लूप ब्रेक में दो स्टेटमेंट रहते ब्रेक रहता है कंटिन्यू रहता है पास स्टेटमेंट रहता है ब्लैक से दोस्तों यह रहता है कि हम सिर्फ ब्रेक लेते हैं अगर हमने मल्टीपल कंडीशन हम चला रहे हैं तो हमें अगर किसी स्टेटमेंट को रोकना है तो इसके लिए हम ब्रेड का यूज कर सकते हैं अगर हमें उस कंडीशन को कंटिन्यू चलाना है तो कंटिन्यू का यूज कर सकते हैं और पास स्टेटमेंट का दोस्तों यह मतलब रहता है कि अगर मान लीजिए हमें कुछ भी नहीं देना है जैसे कि मान लीजिए अभी मैंने कंडीशन लें कि फॉर आईएस इन थे फॉर्म आफ फाइव और हमें नहीं चाहिए तो मैं डायरेक्ट पास लिख दूंगा यह पास हो गया कुछ देर इतनी जगह दोस्तों कि हम यहां पर पास का यूज कर लिया है तो इससे पहले भी रिड्यूस हो जाती है और किसी रीजन से हमने कुछ नहीं एकजुट कर आए तो हमें रख नहीं चाहिए तुम पास लिख सकते हैं बाकी जो लूप कंट्रोल रहते हैं उसमें दो टाइप की चीजें रहती है कंटिन्यू और ब्रेड वह मैं आपको बता रहा हूं अब एक ऑप्शन आता है जिसका नाम है रेंज फंक्शन फंक्शन के बारे में दोस्तों हम आगे भी डिस्कस करेंगे पर फंक्शन का मेनली यही काम रहता है कि क्लॉक ऑफ को डर रहता है जिससे हमारे जो ऑपरेशन किया ऑपरेशन से रहते हैं वह परफॉर्म होते हैं अब सबसे बड़ी बात दोस्तों यह रहती है रेंजर कि रेंजर फंक्शन क्या रहता है कि अगर हमें लूप करवाना स्पेसिफाइड यह सेट टॉप कार्ड में स्पेसिफाई नंबर ऑफ़ टाइम फ्रॉम रेंज फंक्शन का यूज करते हैं जैसे कि रेंजर फंक्शन में आपको यहां पर यूज करके बताता हूं यहां पर मान लीजिए कि मुझे रेंज फंक्शन का यूज करना है मुझे देखना है कि फॉर एक्स कोई वेरिएबल है वह रेंज में है कि नहीं है तो यहां पर मैंने रेंज में लिख दिया सिक्स और अब यहां पर रेंजर चालू हो जाएगा और अब मैं यहां पर अगर प्रिंट करता हूं एक की वैल्यू तो यहां पर देख सकते हैं कि जीरो 12345 से तो यहां पर जो भी वेरिएबल दे रहे हैं वह इस रेंज में जाएगा तो रेंज का यही काम है क्या आखिरी वाले नंबर जो रहता है जहां तक हमें चलानी इंडेक्स 0 से स्टार्ट होती है और पर्टिकुलर उस साइड तक चलता है मतलब जीरो से स्टार्ट होता है और इंक्रीमेंट होता है डिफ़ाल्ट एक से मतलब एक सेट इंक्रीमेंट होता है जैसे कि जिलों के बाद वांट टू थ्री और एंड हो जाता है उस नंबर पर मींस स्पेसिफाइड नंबर पर जैसे कि जीरो 1234 500 और हमेशा की तरह पेंट करवाने की तो 0257 लाएगा क्योंकि इसमें 0 इंक्लूड रहेगा जहां से स्टार्ट हो रहा है और आखिरी वाला जो नंबर है वह एक्सप्लॉइट रहेगा तो आप यहां पर ध्यान रखिएगा एक और रहता है दोस्तों कि रेंजर फंक्शन जो रहता है वह डिपेंड करता है इंक्रीमेंट सीक्वेंस बाय वन जैसे कि मान लीजिए मैं आप एक रेंज रोवर मिशन चलाता हूं कि फॉर एक्सचेंज टू कमा मींस वन को हमार फिक्स कर लेते हैं हम और उसके बाद दोस्तों हम बढ़ते हैं कि हमें प्रिंट करवाना एक्सप्रेस कसम पर सिंपल सा कंसेप्ट याद रखना 12345 तक वैल्यू चलेगी सिक शुरू हो जाएगा 12345 यह गई है1 से स्टार्ट हुई है चालू अब मान लीजिए मैं ऐसा करता हूं कि फॉर एक्सचेंज या मैं ऐसा कर सकता हूं कि ऑइल अब यह दोस्तों यहां पर आप ध्यान से देख रहे होंगे कि एक से इंक्रीमेंट है जैसे एक के बाद दो फिर तीन फिर 45 अगर मान लीजिए मुझे एक से इंक्रीमेंट नहीं करना है मुझे एक से ज्यादा इंक्रीमेंट करना है जैसे मुझे तक रैली चाहिए और दो ह्मे छोड़कर वैल्यूज लेना चाहता हूं तो मैं प्रिंट कर दूंगा एक्स्ट्रा है यहां पर आप ध्यान से देखिएगा कि यहां पर क्या चेंजेस होते हैं 1357 के बाद उन्होंने एक के बाद एक वैल्यू छोड़ दी जैसे कि मुझे टू का जो है वह इंक्रीमेंट चाहिए क्योंकि बाई डिफ़ॉल्ट इंक्रीमेंट वन होता है अब मुझे टू का चाहिए तो वन के बाद वैल्यू का एक टू छुट्टियां छुट्टियां 383 छुट्टियां और छुट्टियां फाई फाई और उसके बाद तो कोई वैल्यू नहीं है तो इस टाइप से दोस्तों रेंज फंक्शन का काम रहता है याद रखिएगा बहुत आगे आगे काम आने वाला है लूप कंट्रोल में आपको बताएंगे अगर आपको लुक को स्किप करना है वह एग्जीक्यूट करना है अगर स्टेटमेंट को तो उसके लिए लूप कंट्रोल काम आते हैं दो टाइप के होते हैं एक ब्रेक हिस स्टेटमेंट रहता है और एक कंटिन्यू रहता है ब्रेक का मतलब यही रहता है कि वह इस टॉप कर देता है एक्जीक्यूशन भले ही कंडीशन टू को और कंटिन्यू में यह रहता है कि वह कंटिन्यू करता है इस ट्रीटमेंट को जब भी हमें कारण टिट्रेशन को स्टॉप करना रहता है या कंटिन्यू करना है नेक्स्ट के साथ अब दोस्तों यहां पर चीज यहां पर इस साइड से क्या है दोस्तों ठीक है दोस्तों यह फंक्शन है अब दोस्तों इसका इससे कर लेता हूं रोटेट कर लेता हूं यह तो दोस्तों अब मैं आपको यहां पर बताना चाहता हूं कि यह फंक्शन का पाठ तो फंक्शन के बारे में आपको बताऊं तो जो फंक्शन है दोस्तों फंक्शन क्या है ए ब्लॉक आफ कोल्ड हैव इंस्पायर्ड यहां पर दोस्तों यह सब रोटेट हो गए हैं एक मिनट दोस्तों यह कर लेते हैं और फिर देख लेते हैं कि जो है वह हम आगे तो दोस्तों अब फंक्शन है में फंक्शन का यूज अब दोस्तों मैं आपको सब्सक्राइब कर लेता हूं क्योंकि दोस्तों कुछ दिक्कत आ रही है वह पूरे पूरा हो चुका है इन थे नॉर्थ है तो दोस्तों इस टाइप से यहां पर यह जो पाइथन 1 मिनट दोस्तों में पीडि़त को वापस से ओपन कर लेता हूं तो दोस्तों यहां पर पायदान एक्जाम नोट्स नोट्स नोट्स ठीक है दोस्तों यहां पर हम स्पीड एक क्लोज करके स्पीड आफ के चलते हैं क्योंकि रोटेशन के कारण कुछ दिक्कत आ गई थी तो दोस्तों अब मैं आपको एक चीज बताना चाहता हूं अब हम फंक्शन टॉपिक स्टार्ट कर रहे हैं फंक्शन टॉपिक का मतलब फंक्शन का मतलब यही रहता है दोस्तों कि अगर क्लॉक ऑफ खोल है तो अगर आ अब लौट फोल्ड है जिससे कि आप स्पेसिफिक को परफॉर्म करते हैं उनको फंक्शन बोलते फंक्शन हमें काफी चीज में काम आता है क्योंकि अगर हमें बहुत सारा कोड नहीं लिखना है हमें कुछ पर्टिकुलर चीजों को ही मेंशन करवाना है तो उसके लिए हम फंक्शन का यूज कर सकते हैं फंक्शन काफी अच्छी चीज हम देख लेते हैं कि अक्षय में फंक्शन है तो दोस्तों यह साइड से कुछ ऐड नहीं दे वापस इसलिए मैं इसे ओपन कर लेता हूं दूसरी टाइम में और उसके पहले में इसे रोटेट कर लेता हूं एक बार कि किस टाइप से रोस्ट हो रहा है तो दोस्तों जो फंक्शन है वह क्लॉक ऑफ कोड है जिससे कि आपका जो फंक्शन है फंक्शन है दोस्तों हों कोड है जो तभी रन होता है जब हम उसको कॉल करते जब भी हम उसमें डाटा पास करते हैं उसको पैरामीटर बोलते हैं फंक्शन में फंक्शन हमको रिटर्न करता है डाटा हैज रिजल्ट आपको कोई भी फंक्शन बनाना है तो उसके लिए आपको डेस कीवर्ड का यूज करना पड़ेगा डी एफ नाम का है कि वह एडिफिस उसके आगे आपको फंक्शन का नाम लिखना है और फिर फंक्शन में अब जो भी ऑपरेशन जो है वह परफॉर्म करवाना चाहते हैं अब दोस्तों मैं आपको यहां पर चीज बताना चाहता हूं कि किस टाइप से आपके जो फंक्शन के ऑपरेशंस है वह परफॉर्म होते हैं है तो दोस्तों फंक्शन जो रहता है वह बेसिकली यह रहता है कि आप जब उसे कॉल करते हैं मीन से तब वह हैरान हो जाता है पर फंक्शन के लिए हमें कुछ इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट को जानना बहुत ही जरूरी है जैसे कि फंक्शन क्लॉक ऑफ को डे कब रन और है जब हम उसे कॉल कर रहे हैं फंक्शन रिटर्न करता है डाटा हैज रिजल्ट आपको बता दिया फंक्शन को कैसे कॉल करना है अब मैं आपको इस फंक्शन बनाकर बताता हूं फटाफट से जैसे कि फंक्शन को बनाने के लिए रैफर करना पड़ता है और मान लीजिए कि मैंने लो कस्टम का एक को फंक्शन बना दिया है इस टाइप से फंक्शन का नाम है और यहां पर मैं कुछ भी अंदर जो है वह अरगुमेंट्स पैरामीटर पास करवाता हूं यह मुझे प्रिंट करवाना है सिंपली ट्रू यह स्प्रिंग हो जाएगी तो मुझे सिंपली प्रिंट करवाना है अब मैं यहां पर लोकेश लिखूंगा और यहां पर तो इस टाइप से जब हम यह जो फंक्शन है अब यहां पर आप देख रहे हैं तो यहां पर हम यह फंक्शन का पूरा जो है वह लिख रखा है अब हमें फंक्शन को रन करवाना है तो यहां पर बस हमें फंक्शन का नाम लिखना है और जो है यह अंडर मींस अ क जो है ब्रैकेट्स लगाने तो इसका है कि जो रहती है फंक्शन कॉलिंग रहती है फंक्शन को बुलाते फंक्शन के अंदर जो भी वैल्यू रहती है वह एडिट यहां पर प्रिंट हो जाती है फिर फंक्शन को बनाने का तरीका रहता है अब आर यू मेंट का मतलब क्या होता है दोस्तों कि यहां पर जो भी हम इन्फॉर्मेशन पास कर रहे हैं फंक्शन में उसका अहम और गुड नाईट बोल रहे हैं फंक्शन में जो भी इन्फॉर्मेशन पास कर रहे हैं और गुड नाइट बोल रहा है और और गवर्नमेंट स्पेसिफाइड होते हैं आफ्टर फंक्शन ने इनसाइड पैरंटहेसेस यह जो पेरेंट्स से इसके अंदर यह जो है दोस्तों यह क्या है और ह्यूमन से और हम जो भी है पेरेंट्स इसमें हम जितने चाहे यहां पर गिवर जोड़ सकते हैं पर हम इन्फॉर्मेशन यहां पर पास कर रहे हैं इसी के साथ-साथ अब यहां पर आप देख सकते हैं कि इस टाइप के फंक्शन है फंक्शन में आपको दो चीजें समझना बहुत ही जरूरी है यह स्कूल फंक्शन में आपको दो चीजें बहुत ही समझना जरूरी है जैसे यह फंक्शन कम कॉल करें और फंक्शन की जो पूरी फंक्शनिंग है मतलब जो पूरा वक्त है उसको अपने समझ लिया कि कैसे आर यू मेंट जा रहे हैं हम जो भी डेटा पास करते हैं फंक्शन में दो आज हम पैरामीटर्स बोलते हैं और कमेंट से जो कि सेपरेटेड हैं पेरेंट्स इसमें अब बढ़ते हैं दोस्तों नेक्स्ट टॉपिक की तरफ सबसे पहले तो मैं आपको पायतन के कुछ स्टेट आपके बारे में बताना भूल गया हूं ऊपर रह गए डाटा इस तो यह हमने इफ्त स्टैटमेंट पड़ा था उसके पहले डाटा इज जाता है तो दोस्तों डाटा इज जनरल यही होते हैं कि डाटा टाइप जो रहते हैं वह ए ग्लास और वेरिएबल रहते हैं मतलब क्लास और वेरिएबल रहते हैं ऑब्जेक्ट आफ क्लासेस मींस डाटा प्लांस रहती है और वेरिएबल जो रहते हैं ऑब्जेक्ट रहे हैं क्योंकि पाइथन में हर चीज जो रहती है वह इस टाइप से बोली जाती है कि पाकिस्तान में हर चीज रिलेटिव विकेट आप के रूप में रहती है डाटा रहता है तो वेरिएबल रहता है वह करता है डाटा डिफरेंट डिफरेंट डिफरेंट कर सकते हैं तो चलिए यहां पर डाटा स्ट्रक्चर है जैसे कि नंबरों के लिए इस चैनल को सब्सक्राइब करें हेलो दोस्तों यहीं है पाइथन में डाटा जो रहता है वह ऑब्जेक्ट के फॉर्म में रहता आई जब वह ब्रिटेन ऑब्जेक्ट हो या ऑब्जेक्ट हम टाइटन से बना रहे हो अब बिल्डिंग टाइप का दोस्तों मतलब क्या होता है बिल्डिंग टाइप का दोस्तों मतलब यह रहता है कि प्रोग्राम इजी से लिख सकते हैं हम एक्सटेंशन का कंप्लीट है और दोस्तों सॉरी मैं आपको एक बात गलत बोल गया कि पाइथन में जो भी चीज रहती है वह एवरीथिंग भी प्रोसेसेस एंड ऑब्जेक्टिव टाइप ऑफ द टाइटंस में जो भी चीज रहती है प्रोसेस करते हैं वह एक त्यौहार फंक्शन के बाद अगली चीज जो कि हो सकती है या लिस्ट टेंपल डिक्शनरी टॉपिक दोस्तों थोड़ा लिक्विड नहीं है पर आप इसको आसानी से पढ़ सकते हैं मैं और से बता देता हूं दोस्तों वीडियो काफी लंबा हो जाएगी सब्सक्राइब बहुत ही जरूरी है फंक्शन की फटाफट से बता देता हूं यह फंक्शन इस दीप नाम का एड्रेस से हम कि वह डेव स्टीवर्ट साहेब स्टार्ट कर रहे हैं जब हमें कोई फंक्शन बनाना होता है यह फंक्शन का नाम है इसके अंदर जो भी चीज दे रहे हैं यह पैरामीटर है और यहां पर यह आरजू मेंटेन याद रखेगा पेरेंट्स इसके अंदर जो भी रहेगा वह अरगुमेंट रहेगा यह फंक्शन कॉल मे जो भी रहेगा और कमेंट या हम इन्फॉर्मेशन पास करें और यह पैरामीटर और यह फंक्शन की डेफिनेशन है मतलब यहां पर लिख रहा हूं तो यह पूरी फंक्शन की डेफिनेशन हो गई और यहां पर फंक्शन कॉलिंग हो रही है तो इस टाइप का आपको ध्यान रखना है कि बाई डिफ़ॉल्ट इस टाइप से यह दोस्तों इतने काम की चीज नहीं है और दोस्तों एक रेंडम नंबर जेनरेटर का भी मौजूद होता है पाकिस्तान में जिससे कि हम है अगर रेंडम नंबर जेनरेटर करना है तो हम रेंडम मॉड्यूल की यूज की तरफ से इंपोर्ट करना है हमको सबसे पहले रेंडम को और रेंडम को इंपोर्ट करके हम जो है मॉडल्स को एकजुट कर सकते हैं अब दोस्तों बढ़ते हैं ले पाइथन के डाटा स्ट्रक्चर्स की तरफ जो कि है लिस्ट टेंपल डिशनरी सेट लिस्ट क्या होता है लिस्ट रहता ग्रुप आफ डिफरेंट टाइप ऑफ एलिमेंट जैसा आपने सी प्लस प्लस में और सी में यह जवाब में एड्रेस पढ़ रखा होगा उसका इसे यहां पर लिस्ट रहती है लिस्ट की कुछ करैक्टेरिस्टिक्स रहती है सबसे पहले लिस्ट को कैसे डिफाइन करते हैं मैं आपको यहां पर बता देता हूं कि लिस्ट को डिफाइन करने के लिए आपको कुछ नहीं करना है यहां पर आप जैसे लिस्ट या मान लीजिए आप यहां पर लोकेश कुछ लेते हैं लोकेश नाम प्लेलिस्ट है और आप जब भी स्क्वायर फिट का यूज करते हैं और इसके अंदर जो भी वैल्यू देते हैं वह लिस्ट हालांकि अगर आप देखेंगे लोकेश का तो आपको यहां पर मालूम चल जाएगा कि यह जो है क्लास यह लिस्ट है तो दोस्तों इस टाइप से यह जो रहती है लिस्ट रहती है अब हम देख लेते हैं कि लिस्ट के कुछ प्रॉपर्टीज के रहती है लिस्ट की कुछ करैक्टेरिस्टिक्स रहती है वह यह थी कि मी टू टेबल अब यह ड्यूटेबल का मतलब क्या होता है मी टू टेबल का मतलब यह होता है दोस्तों कि हम लिस्ट को चेंज कर सकते हैं अगर हमें मान लीजिए लिस्ट की वैल्यू को रिप्लेस करना है ऐड करना है तो लिस्ट में ड्यूटेबल रहता है हम उसे आगे भी चेंज कर सकते हैं लिस्ट लीनियर डाटा स्ट्रक्चर ओं थे मिक्सचर आफ एलिमेंट्स रहते हैं वेवलेंथ रहती लिस्ट की कुछ लिस्ट अपसेट डिक्शनरी इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट 4 पॉइंट याद रखिएगा लिस्ट ऐसा कलेक्शन रहता है जो कि ऑर्डर देता है और चेंजेबल रहता चेंज कर सकते हैं डुप्लीकेट मेंबर भी आ सकते हैं टॉप पहले सा रहता है जो कि आर्डर रहता अनचेंजेबल बता मतलब टप्पल में म्यूट टेबल रहता है सेट जो रहता है वह नोडिया आने इंडेक्स बैठा वह उसमें भी कोई डुप्लीकेट मेंबर नहीं आते हैं डिक्शनरी एक ऐसा कलेक्शन है जो कि चेंजेबल तो है लिस्ट की तरफ पर अनवांटेड है और इंडेक्स डुप्लीकेट मेंबर अब दोस्तों मैं आपको यहां पर बताना चाहता हूं कि इस साइड से लिस्ट प्ले लिस्ट में अगर आपको किसी भी एलिमेंट को एक्सेस करना है तो आप कुछ नहीं करेंगे लिस्ट को उसके इंडेक्स नंबर से पहचान लेंगे जैसे कि यह स्टूडेंट है तो इसका इंडेक्स नंबर शेज़वान इसका टू है तो आपको प्रिंट करना है बस लिस्ट का नाम और इंडेक्स टाइप करना है और आप यहां पर एक्सेस कर जाएंगे फिर इस साइड से कुछ चौक फंक्शंस है या कुछ मेथड से लिस्ट कि जैसे कि रिमूव हो गई अकाउंट हो गई एक्सटेंड हो गई पॉल गई इन सभी को आप अच्छे से पढ़ लीजिएगा क्योंकि इंपोर्टेंट मेथड से लिस्ट की लिस्ट के मेथड आपको खुद पढ़नी पड़ेगी दोस्तों क्योंकि वहां पर जितने भी क्वेश्चन से वह मैं ऑलरेडी लिस्ट के बता चुका हूं तो इन्हें भी आफ रिवर कर सकते हैं और पढ़ सकते हैं कि अब दोस्तों नीचे देख लेते हैं कि और कितने सारे टॉपिक्स बच गए हैं यह इस टाइप से आपने नोट्स रिवर कर सकते हैं दोस्तों यह अब दोस्तों मैं आपको स्क्रीन के बारे में बताऊं तो जनरली स्प्रिंग क्या होता है स्प्रिंग सीक्वेंस आफ कैरेक्टर होता है जिसको यूज करके हम स्टार्ट करते अरे प्रेजेंट करते टेक्स्ट भेज दो इन्फॉर्मेशन एक्टिव का यूज जब हम इसीलिए करते हैं स्टिकर का मतलब स्प्रिंग यह होता है इस ट्रिक में मैं आपको दो चीजें बताना चाहता हूं कि मान लीजिए मैंने एक रिक्वेस्ट टू लोकेश लिखा टिंगल इनवर्टेड कॉमा में और यह रिक्वेस्ट 2111 डोकोमो में लोकेशन लेता तो मेरी जो वैल्यू रहेगी दोस्तों को सेम रहेगी कि सिंगल और डबल इनवर्टेड कॉमा स्प्रिंग में सेम ट्रीट होता है अब दोस्तों हम कर लेते हैं यह सिलाई से इनके बारे में हम देख लेंगे आने वाली क्विज में इस टाइप से यहां पर हिस्ट्री कुछ मेथड से इनको आपको लेना है आपको नोट्स में अच्छे तरीके से मिलने वाला है और दोस्तों यह डिक्शनरी डिक्शनरी चप्पल और यह दोस्तों आप देख लीजिए क्योंकि मैंने इनके बारे में इतना यह नोट से जो है वह नोट्स मैं आपको सारी चीजें मिल जाएगी जिसे अगर आप चप्पल की बात करेंगे तो टप्पल को अगर हमें बनाना है तो टेंपल को हम यह फ्रंट ब्रैकेट से बनाते हैं और जिस टाइप सी बनाते बस कपल का एक ही चीज रहती थी वह अनचेंजेबल रहता है टप्पल क्या मेथड भी पढ़ सकते हैं सेक्स के बारे में बताऊं तो सेट को यूज करके हम इंस्टॉल करते मल्टीपल आइटम सिंगल वेरिएबल में सेट को बनाने के लिए हमें कर ली ब्रेड का यूज करना पड़ता है यह नो डोर एंड एक्टिव रहते हैं कि डिक्शनरी की बात करूं तो डिक्शनरी आइटम स्टार्ट होते हैं की वैल्यू पर में बींस एक की रहेगी और उससे related वैल्यू रहेगी तो दोस्तों यह भी आप इसमें से देख लीजिएगा काफी सारी मेथड से इसमें तो दोस्तों और डिक्शनरी के बारे में इस तरह से आप डिक्शनरी को डिक्शनरी के प्रॉपर्टीज और यह सब पढ़ सकते हैं जैसे कि अगर आपको डिक्शनरी बनाना है तो डिक्शनरी बनाने का बहुत ही सिंपल तरीका है दोस्तों कि फेस यह जो डिक्शनरी रहेगी धोइए उसमें अपने कर ली प्रेसिडेंट्स मींस आपने कर ली अब रेडी है अब लोकेश लिखा और उसकी वैल्यू नो दादी उसके बाद दोस्तों अपने कोमल लगाया और उसके बाद दोस्तों जैसे कि यहां पर डिक्शनरी अब डिक्शनरी में आपको कभी भी बताने के लिए आप खाली नहीं लिख सकते हैं इसे नहीं तो इससे घर आ सकती है दोस्तों जैसे आपको एक पर्टिकुलर बताने के लिए बताना पड़ेगा कि किस टाइप से आपकी कौन सी है वैल्यू है है तो दोस्तों जैसे कि अब मैं आपको यहां पर ही बता देता हूं कि किस टाइप से इसकी वैल्यू है जैसे स्पर्म लिखा है तो इस पर एक पर्टिकुलर अवेलेबल है उसके अंदर मींस धैर्य और स्पेन की ज्वेलरी है वह दूसरी ओर लोकेश की वैल्यू जो है वह है तो इस टाइप से जो डिक्शनरी रहती है वह डिफाइन होती है यह चीज है और एक वैल्यू है तो की वैल्यू पैर के टाइम्स में आप इन्ही प्रॉपर्टीज पड़ी है आपको नोट्स में मिल जाएगी वीडियो लंबी हो रही है दोस्तों इसलिए मैं आपको जल्दी से जल्दी यह बताने की कोशिश कर रहा हूं पर यह जो है मींस यह जितने भी टॉपिक्स हैं स्प्रिंग से रिलेटेड आप इंटरनेट से पकड़ सकते हैं पाइथन आप इसमें से पूरा देख सकते हैं आपको नोट्स में से सारी चीजें मिल जाएगी इसी के साथ-साथ जो एडवांस टॉपिक जैसे कि सिलाई सिंह और दोस्तों यह एक्स्ट्रा

=== TCS Ninja Hands On Coding Previous Year Questions | TCS NQT | TCS Ninja Preparation #tcsnqt ===

Transcript:
hello everyone i am lukesh and welcome back to the channel so friends this video is related to tcs ninja preparation for the 2022 badge and for the upcoming nqt exam in this video we discuss the previous year coding question and how to solve this question and question explanation with solution pdf so this video is related to 2022 batch and other batches who are prepared for upcoming tcs and qt exam and the tcs ninja hiring so let's start the video so this is the complete pdf of tcs ninja preparation and tcs nqt preparation for all watches previous year question series plus practice for tcs and qt updates join our telegram group by this link and this is a pdf i will share on my telegram channel as well as on blog okay so we start the coding series from today and uh soon in the upcoming videos we continue this series this is the part one video so here is our question that oxygen value the question is ask in the previous lot of tcs and qt exam so the selection of mpcs exams include a fitness test so there is a exam of physical fitness and in which there is a fitness test which is conducted on the ground there will be batch of three trainees appearing for running test on track for three rounds means we have a batch of three trainees and they will appear for running tests on track for three rounds you need to record your oxy you need to record their oxygen level after every round means after every round finish we have to record their oxygen level after trainees are finished with all rounds calculate for each training his average oxygen level over the three round and select the one with the highest average oxygen level as the fittest training if more than one trainee attend the same highest average level they all need to be selected display the fittest training or trainers and the highest average oxygen level okay so the in the question they said that they said that we have a batch of three trainees okay this is the first point and we have a batch of three trainees okay and there is a round three okay so if i talk about like this is the batch one this is the best two and this is the batch three so we have a 21 and 22 and 3 oxygen level because we have to uh know about the three rounds and we have to record for the three rounds so there is a batch one batch two and batch three and uh there is a trainee one training to train e3 okay so in the bash2 we have also values of 21 22 and 23 so this is the oxygen level we have to calculate okay and uh we have to find the average oxygen level over the three round and select the one with the highest average oxygen level if the both are same or if the some training are same to another trainee so we have to all the selected for that and if it's not in the range so we have to declare the unfit training means there is a note important point that the oxygen value entered should not be expect accepted if it's not in the range between 1 200 okay so the oxygen value level ranges 1 200 okay is uh that's why the second point is if they calculate maximum average oxygen value of the training is below 70 then declare the trainee as unfit with a meaningful message as on all trainees are unfit average oxygen value should be rounded means we have to not taken in decimal form okay we have to not taken in decimal form and we have to take an in round format okay so this is the very important point that we have to find the first the value of trainees and we not taken in the uh the range should be 100 and after that we have to round the value and the average oxygen value should be rounded okay this is the very important point and they said if they calculate maximum average oxygen value is below 70 then declare all the 20 unfit this is the example input as you can see on that there is a three batch so there is a three round so total value is nine like a 95 92 and 95 okay so the 95 92 and 95 is the batch one trainee one value is 95 and trainee two value is 92 and 23 value is 95 okay in the case of same like bash to 90 to 90 92 as you can see that in the 92 90 92 and the third batch is 2190 value 20 to 92 and 90. as you can see that the output is training number one and training number three because as we can see that training number one and training number three have highest oxygen level and if the highest oxygen level is same in some of the other training so we have to select like 21 and 23 have highest oxygen level in both the three round as you can see that in it will be same as you can see that in the total three round the highest oxygen level is t1 and 33 okay so the training number one and training number three have highest oxygen level and as you can see that we have to consider value in this format like round one oxygen value of 21 like that and oxygen value of 22 like that and oxygen value of 23 like that okay so this type of this is the complete information regarding the question and the oxygen value must be given format as in above example if any wrong input the final output should be display invalid input so this is the very important point what about the average oxygen level we have to consider over a average oxygen level in this format like we have to consider the t1 value t1 plus t1 and divided by 3 so if it is less than 70 and if it is less than 70 so we have to declare the training as unfit so this is the complete question regarding that so how to solve this question and what is the approach for solving this question i will attach the solution in python and cc plus plus c plus plus okay as you can see that you can prefer from that pdf i will share on my blog and channel okay blog on telegram channel so for that i will just discuss the solution in python we have to take on the value of t1 t2 and 33 t3 means our t1 t2 t3 means the training one value 22 and training 3 value and we will be considered for three times because there is a uh three rounds for the three batches okay we have to initialize the first account because uh there is a while loop and the while loop check the condition when the condition is true okay as uh true long as long as true okay so we have to check the condition using the while low firstly the condition comes that x is equals to in input so in the uh in the value of x so there is a value come off 201 like 95 okay firstly if we check that 95 is less than or is greater than or equals to 1 and 95 and is used for the joining the statement okay so 95 is less than or equal to 100 means this condition is true so we will go to this part if they check that if 95 percentile 3 equals to 1 so we have to perform this operation t1 is equals to t1 plus x okay you understand my point that we have to take the value first like if i talk about if i talk about this solution so you can see that we have to take the value first and after that if the condition not satisfied so we go to alif part and if the alif part is also not considered so we go to else apart and in this following operation should be performed after that this will not work so we have to pray uh we have a else statement so this will print the invalid input invalid input and there is a exit okay so what is the a1 a2 and a3 the in the question there is a one important point that average oxygen value should be rounded okay if we find the average oxygen value in that so we have to consider average oxygen value so this will round the t1 t2 and t3 value and after that it will be print a1 a2 and a3 and there is a one important point that if the calculated maximum average oxygen value of training is below 70 then declare the trainee as unfit so it will check the following condition that a1 is less than or equal to 70 or is less than or equals to 70 and a3 is less than or equals to 70 okay so it will print all trainees are unfit if the condition is if the condition is true and there is a exit and if the condition is not true and it will check that if the a1 is greater than or equals to a2 and a1 is greater than equals to a3 means a trainee number one value is high for that we have to check the training number two and training number three value so this is the smallest concept and this is the full concept that is related to training number and if we uh if we just uh there is an invalid syntax so okay so we have to just correct that syntax okay uh that okay so the question is now correct and uh if we just add the value like 95 92 and 95 okay so we add the value like 95 okay so when we run this okay let me just paste the values okay so this is not the values we have to run again and if we take particular input from that okay so this is the very important point that we have to take the values all all the values related to that okay and after after all the values passing through this and and we just paste the values in that okay and the last value is 90 so as you can see that this is the output like training number one and the training number three similar that okay so this is the complete concept for this question and if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section you you can check the solution in python as well as in c plus plus and i already solve that question and what is the average you have to find and what is the batch one batch two and batch three criteria there is three round i hope this video is useful for everyone if you have any doubt you can drop your query in the comment section thanks for watching videos soon in the upcoming videos we solve the so many questions

stocks is 11 lp and reallocation bonus is 1.5 lpa okay so this is the complete package details for the amazon sde role okay if i talk about pattern so there are so many rounds in the amazon exam there is a aptitude plus coding round also multiple telephonic round on-site interviews means uh during the situation uh during the current situation the interviews are going virtual and the hr plus managerial round and there is a fifth round called bar raise around so we have to discuss one by one all-round so the return online coding round that after proper evolution of the candidate profile okay first you have to submit all your information on the amazon website you have to fill all your data and all your information they will give you they will give you opportunity so first round is the written online coding round uh the interview process start with the written test which is conducted to assess the logical and technical skills of the candidate so the written round is the first one if i talk about the return round pattern so there is a written round test is followed by online coding round means the amazon online test con questions are based on dbms operating system data structures and algorithm okay there is a coding question and if i talk about multiple telephony grounds so during the first phone call the hr or senior member will ask a basic question on the candidate's project and resume so this is the second round for the multiple telephony crowd so the interview will the interviewer will check if the candidate is good fit or not okay so understand you that this is the multiple multiple telephonic round if i talk about on-site interviews so the on-site interviews are the technical round of the amazon interview process okay so the first face face-to-face on-site interview and the in-house interview and the off-campus means on the virtual interview as an algorithm round with two to four question the frequently asked questions are on data structure matrices operating system recursion based concept the next technical round is bit harder than the previous round on similar concept so this is the virtual round interview concept okay as you understand first if you clear the first online coding round or the written round there is a multiple telephony ground and there is a technical round also and during the situation the round are also virtual if i talk about hr or hiring managers round so it is an intensive technical round where candidate will solve problems on data structure algorithms and some tricky puzzles okay and the last interview round or we can say that not the interview round but it is the round that is called bar raiser round the amazon hiring process does not end with the hr round the bar raiser is the final and the most crucial hurdle in judging the candidate placement the bar raiser is a supreme recruiter who will make the best long term hiring decision so this is the last round okay and this is the very important round all rounds will be completed but this round decision is very important by each hire the bar results ensure that there is the average amazon employee in performance okay so the bar raiser objective advisor that evoluting the leadership principles of the candidate so this type of round is called the bar raiser round and this is the total pattern for the amazon exams but it will be changed according to companies condition terms and condition because they will hire for the role as d but if they change in some pattern so it will be totally changed by company and if i talk about on-site interview so i think the interview will be conducted virtually during this situation okay if i talk about resources for amazon sde preparation so for aptitude logical reasoning or verbal you can check practice website india wax and book indiabix website is the very good website for the aptitude you can practice and book name is rs agrawal servo as simple as that for aptitude but for coding you have to prepare on the geeksforgeeks website and there are so many platform but generally one of my friend is in amazon and soon i will share his interview experience on channel for all of you for interview preparation check gigs for gigs for pattern you can check fast prep website so there is a one important point that on the amazon on the gigs for geeks website you can check the you can check the all the related articles for the amazon okay so the you can check what are the some questions that they ask in telephony ground one and in house round okay in house two round okay you can see that in house three and semi technical hiring manager and these are the some questions that they ask in the amazon different route and the bar raiser round is that as you can see that again the same question why amazon over the previous company one negative point and one uh one positive point from the amazon india site okay as you can see that this type of uh this type of questions they ask and you can practice so many questions on the gigs for gigs website okay and this is the amazon interview experience you can check the what is the round first and what is the interview interview second interview third and final interview and if i talk about practice platform so you can prefer gigs for gigs because this in the amazon exam the basic concept is very important okay so this type of this type of questions you have to solve and in this you have to solve so many higher concepts question like you have to solve on data structure and you have to focus on ds and algo because ds and lgo is very important for the amazon's placement okay so what next if if you have any doubt and if you have any doubt related to amazon sd exam pattern or how to prepare for that just comment down below and if you find the good content please like and share the video with your friends okay if the uh if the more candidates just say that please make preparation videos for that we have also i have also shared

discussed that i have not discussed so many type again in this video but we have to understand the all the points clearly for the programming section we have 15 minutes for the programming logic hands-on coding 45 minutes means total 60 minutes are there for the programming section and if i talk about so the mcq so the programming logic content mcq multiple choice question contain 10 question and you have 15 minutes and coding have two questions hands on exercise first and hands on exercise second first question 15 minute and first question 30 minutes so if i talk about syllabus so you can check the syllabus for the syllabus for the tcs syllabus for the tcs and qt exam related to programming section so there is one important point okay so as uh as from the previous trend there are the basic of c like four to five question object oriented program have one to two question data structure i have three question advanced data structure only one question so what are the types of what are the topics like data type input output based pointers called by value reference okay so there is a one important website that the java key point okay so as i open this website then you can see so many mcqs here okay as you can see that there are so many mcqs that is related to uh c programming and you can check different type of complete a tutorial that is related on java t point this is the very good website this is not a promotion video as i can say that this is just for informing all the candidates what is the best website to prepare okay so this is the first part that if you have to prepare the basic of c you can check the four to five question and if i talk about object oriented programming so you can prefer so many videos on youtube that already uploaded these some channels on video that is what is the procedural versus object oriented programming this is the mcq related questions if i talk about data structure you can see you can see so many videos and there are so many channels plus book as i already discussed for the data structure resources what is advantage advanced data structure question only one question so there is one important point that okay for the mcq section okay if i talk about mcq section so there is a if i talk about mcq section so there is one point you have to prepare well for the practice means you uh you have one month left okay as we know that you have one month or sometime more left so you have to prepare well for the exam by practicing this mcq on website means you have to prepare on the website and you can check all the required resources that here okay and this is the best website for the preparation for the mgq and you can check c c plus plus okay c c plus plus here and if you want to check the object oriented programming

if i talk about coding section so the coding is the very important part and i love this and if i talk about coding so there is a one question and there is a one question okay so the total question is true and the from the previous trend the first question is always some easy and this okay second code second moderate and advanced okay it will totally depend on tcs team whether they are some of the candidates say that if i choose python and if i write code in python so the compiler not work so it's the totally wrong method because the compiler has work in some aspect you have to clear all the test cases that is given in the code okay the this is the first question and this is the second question so the first question is easy not so much high and not so much tough and soon we start the preparation for the coding question and the second question is as advanced question okay so if i talk about skills that are available for the practice how to practice for the programming okay as i see that resources plus practice platform so resources i already shared and you can check the ppt again but if i talk about practice so you can just go to hacker rank platform and in this there are so many available skill available for the practice like if you want to code in c c plus plus or python or data structures or algorithms so you can do so many question because if the if the moderate or high level question is asked so you can check the data structure and algorithm questions also and there are a lot of questions there you can see that this is the sub domains topic so this is the best platform to practice you can check you can check also hacker earth or the lead code according to your preparation so how to score good marks in programming section if i talk about programming section

हेलो हेलो एवरीवन आइए हम लोग क्वेश्चन वेलकम बैक टू माय चैनल दोस्तों आज से हम टीसीएस निंजा प्रिपरेशन सीरीज स्टार्ट करने वाले जैसा कि हमें पता है कि टीसीएस की तरफ से 2022 बेच के लिए निंजा केयरिंग स्टार्ट हो चुकी है तो प्रिपरेशन सीरीज में हम जो है अलग-अलग टॉपिक देखेंगे आज हम न्यूमेरिकल एबिलिटी के प्रीवियस ईयर क्वेश्चंस देखेंगे हम 5 से 10 क्वेश्चन से करेंगे यह फर्स्ट है आने वाली वीडियोस बहुत अच्छी होने वाली आप सभी को बहुत अच्छे से समझाने वाला हूं अब यह टीसीएस निंजा प्रिपरेशन कि मैंने जितनी भी यहां पर जो चीजें हैं उनको इंक्लूड कर दिया है आप प्रीवियस ईयर क्वेश्चंस प्लस प्रैक्टिस अब हमारे टेलीग्राम ग्रुप को ज्वाइन कर सकते हैं इसी के साथ का दिए इंस्टीट्यूट से रिलेटेड नहीं है टीसीएस से रिलेटेड है यहां पर आपको इंपॉर्टेंट अपडेट्स मिलेंगे और YouTube चैनल के लिए यह जो पीडीएफ है यह मैं आप सभी के साथ शेयर कर दूंगा टेलीग्राम चैनल पर भी गौर करें तो चलिए शुरुआत करते हमारा जो फर्स्ट क्वेश्चन है वह कुछ इस तरह से यह कि मतलब उन्होंने यहां पर यह बताया कि इस पॉइंट इस पर सेंट मोर एफिशिएंट एंड डिप्ड इनटू पर्सन कैन कंपलीट थिस वर्क इन सिक्स डेज इन हाउ मेनी डेज एगो वर्किंग अलोन कैन कंप्लीट द मतलब यहां पर बताया जा रहा है कि यह जो है यहां पर मैं आपको बता देता हूं कि यहां पर यह सेलेक्ट कर लेता हूं यहां पर यह जो यह हैव यह 20% मोर एफिशिएंट है जिससे बीच ओके उन्होंने फिर क्या क्वेश्चन हमें बोला है मैं यहां पर इसे कर लें तो 10 पर सेंट मोर एफिशिएंट दी है अगर दोनों पर्सन ए कंपलीट करते पिस्तौल व को 60-day में तो कितने दिन में एक व करेगा अलोन कैन कंपलीट वर्क मतलब अगर यह दोनों मिलकर 6 डेज में अगर एक काम को करते हैं ठीक है ठीक है दोस्तों यहां पर 6 डेज में यह दोनों एक काम को करते हैं तो कितने दिन में यह जो है वह यहां पर अकेला करेगा अब इसी के साथ मैं आपको यहां पर बताता हूं कि हम यहां पर क्या यूज कर सकते हैं कि हमें पता है कि यह जो है वह 20% ठीक है यहां पर हमें एक बात याद रखनी है कि वह 20% मोर एफिशिएंट ठीक है मोर एफिशिएंट 20 है अगर बी बर्थडे वर्क कर रहा है हंड्रेड यूनिट ठीक है जैसे मान लीजिए कि हम यहां पर लेते हैं एग्जांपल जैसे कि ट्वेंटी परसेंट मोर एग्रीकल्चर परसेंट जो है मोर एफिशिएंट है तो अगर बी जो है वह वर्क कर रहा है हंड्रेड यूनिट फॉर डे तोए जो है ठीक है यहां पर मैं एक अपॉइंट ले रहा हूं इसी के साथ-साथ हम आपको पूरा समझेंगे यहां पर यह जो है वह इन रेडियो नेटवर्क कर रहा है तो मतलब है वह अगर रोज बात कर रहा है अंदर यूनिट हमने यह माना है तो यह क्या करेगा 120 करेगा क्योंकि यहां पर उन्होंने टोटली बता दिया कि हमें 20% हिसाब से चलना है अब जैसे मान लीजिए अगर हम यूनिट के कंपैरीजन में करेंगे तो ऐ अगर हम उन्हें ज़ूम मतलब हंड्रेड यूनिट काम करता है तो भी जो रहेगा वह 120 यूनिट्स काम करेगा ठीक है यह बात का ध्यान रखना है इस चीज को आप मत भूलिएगा क्योंकि यह बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है अगर यह जो है वह अंग्रेजी यूनिट बीच जो है वह अंग्रेज यूनिट काम करता है तो यह जो है वह क्या करेगा 120 यूनिट काम करेगा तो टोटल कितने हो जाएगी 220 यूनिट पडेगी हो जाएगी ठीक है इस साइड से हम यूनिट के हिसाब से क्यों ले रहा है क्योंकि यहां पर हमें क्वेश्चन समझने में जो रहेगी रहेगी ठीक है तो यह मैंने आपको चीज बताई कि मान लीजिए अगर भी जो है वह क्या कर रहा है हंड्रेड यूनिट काम कर रहा है एक दिन में तो जो यह है वह कितना करेगा 120 करेगा आप यहां पर यह चीज को ध्यान रखिएगा इसके बाद हम यह देखते हैं कि उनको कितना टाइम लग रहा है उनको टीडीएस लग रहे हैं 300 वर्क मतलब एक काम को कंप्लीट करने में पीछे और वर्कशॉप कंप्लीट करने में सीधे लग रहे तो आप एक को कितना टाइम लगेगा देखिए टोटल बार अगर हम देखें तो यहां पर वह टोटल वर्क कितना कराएं उन्होंने 220 यूनिट करें मतलब हंड्रेड यूनिट तो भी नहीं करा और 120 यूनिट किसने पीने का है तो यहां पर हम इनका मल्टीप्लाई कर देंगे क्योंकि हमें टोटल वर्क देखना है टोटल में 60d लग रहे हैं तो हम यहां पर इसे कंसीडर कर लेंगे उसके बाद अब हमें सिर्फ एक के लिए निकाल है ठीक है मैं इसे यहां से रैप कर देता हूं अब हम सिर्फ एक हेल्दी निकाल है दोस्तों क्वेश्चन बहुत ही सिंपल है इसमें कोई ऐसा टॉपिक बात नहीं है बस यह हमें क्या देखना है सबसे पहले हमने देखा कि 200 यूनिट काम करना है तो यह 120 करेगा इसके बाद टीडीएस लगते हैं तो टोटल कितना फर्क और है 220 यूनिट्स और है तो हमने उसको मल्टिप्लाई कर दिया देश से उसके बाद आप हमें देखना है अखिलेश एक है लिए तो बस अब एक यह में देखना है तो सीधा का हम्म बस इसे डिवाइड कर देंगे 120 छह और जब हम इसकी वैल्यू कैलकुलेट करेंगे तो टोटल 10 रहेगा वह एक और लगेंगे एक अकेले काम कंप्लीट करने के लिए ठीक है आई होप यह क्वेश्चन आप सभी को समझ का यहां पर जो हमारा आंसर है 110 होगा बढ़ते हम

Transcript:
hello everyone i am lokesh and welcome back to the channel so friends this video is related to 2022 tcs free nqt exam how to start preparation for tcs free and qt exam as we know that tcs ninja hiring is officially announced for the 2022 batch and registration is ongoing you can check the previous videos and done the registration okay so this video is the fifth part for the tcs series and we have to prepare for this exam also but this video is very important because if you are from b b tech me m tech ms mca or msc you can eligible for the tcs free and qt exam what are the some resources plus a strategy to crack the exam how to crack pcs exam in first attempt and there is a specific presentation for all of you that i made so let's start the video okay so how to start preparation exam pattern resources plus strategy important for 2022 batch okay so there is a general introduction that what is a tcs and qt free exam what is the pattern of tcs and qt exam syllabus for tcs and qt exam resources strategy to crack in first attempt okay so the tcs nqt is also known as tcs national qualifier test is a placement exam organized by tcs to hire student for software engineer training the qualifying students are selected for tcs ninja and tcs digital profile but tcs confirms that they will hire for the tcs ninja profile tcs ninja is named given by tcs to recruit fresh graduate across india through a national qualifier test get a package of around 3.5 lpa and tcs will use nqt score to also hire other student for digital profile that is called seven lpa packets okay so this is the tcs nqt exam overview what about the pattern for the 2022 batch as you can see that test pattern for tcs ninja hiring is year of passing 2022 there are two parts like cognitive uh pro means the cognitive skills and the it programming section there are there are one part a and part two in the part a the group name is the cognitive skills what are the some cognitive skills points like numerical ability verbal and reasoning ability and they mention the time for the programming there are programming logic questions of mcq multiple choice question and there is a hands-on coding question for the 45 minutes there are total 60 minutes and total test duration is 180 minutes this is the complete pattern for the tcs ninja hiring year of passing 2022. okay so this is the syllabus for tcs entity exam means this contains some parts but we have to understand the previously pattern that the uh follow by the tcs team okay so this is the first cognitive exam as you can see that all is same in that like 40 minutes 30 minutes and 50 minutes so it will be same as the previous pattern like numerical ability have 26 question verbal ability have 24 question reasoning ability have 30 questions if i talk about subject and qt so this is the second stage of exam like the part b programming logic and hands-on coding so it will be important to get placed in tcs it company its score is very important means you have to qualify for the cognitive and the programming section so if i talk about programming section so you can see that there is a 15 minute for the programming logic and hands-on coding for the 45 minute so as you can see that the 15 minutes for the 10 questions and the 15 minutes the 15 minutes is for the one question coding hands-on coding means you have to make the code for that and there is a two coding question for 50 minute and 30 minutes advance and high level okay so this type of this is the mcq based so difficulty is medium to hard and if i talk about cognitive ability so we can discuss the difficulty also so you can see that there is no negative marking if i talk about previously exam you can switch between topic you can switch between questions so it will be totally dependent previous but if there is a changes so it will be totally depend on tcs team okay but the pattern is follow same i think this year also so if i talk about syllabus of tcs and qt exam so as we can see that there are number of coding questions number of questions for the numerical is 26 verbal is 24 reasoning is 30 programming logic is 10 and coding is true what are the total time and as you can see that difficulty level and importance okay so the difficulty level for numerical verbal and reasoning is medium programming logic is high and coding is also high because they consider the overall score and after your score is very good so they will schedule a interview call for all of you okay so if i talk about particular syllabus of numerical ability so i just add the numerical verbal reasoning programming and coding so if i talk about numerical ability section so there are the number system lcm and scf divisibility question number and decimal function if i talk about menstruation so geometry area shapes and perimeter related questions arithmetical ability have percentage ratio proportion work and time speed time and distance profit and loss average equation edges probability clock and calendar series and progression and if i talk about elementary statistics you can see that mean median mode variance standard deviation this will be check from the top website called the prep insta and they will they consider all the syllabus or all the syllabus in the very right manner you can check the previous questions from that website also okay but we have to prepare for that exam okay you can see that this is the complete syllabus for the numerical ability if i talk about verbal ability so in this english grammar and reading comprehension sections are included so in the english grammar there are word completion sentence error identification arrangement formal or informal sentences meanings this type of questions are asked generally in the verbal ability okay if i talk about reasoning ability so there are the some topics that are very important for the reasoning like identifying word you have word pattern question letter series question numeric pattern have number series problem solving sitting arrangement blood relation data arrangement decision making statement based logical vent diagram based visual spatial reasoning question so this type of topics are very important and this is the complete syllabus for the reasoning ability this is the programming section as you can see that there are the questions related to basics of c and data structure and object oriented programming okay and advanced data structure only one question okay so as you can see that there are ten questions for the programming section so four to five questions of basic c object oriented programming question data structure and advanced data structure questions okay and this is the coding section you will have given two coding questions with a time limit of 15 and 30 minutes the questions are two time is 15 plus 30 minutes there is no negative marking you can expect the questions from the following concept like number series printing string matrix pythagoras triplet lcm of three number this type of questions are asked previously in the exam but we have to solve with the advanced coding question also because this is the very important exam for all of you and they will check all your skills in that exams means they will check your aptitude also and they will check your coding also so this is the complete syllabus okay if i talk about resources for tcs nqt exam this is the most important point for aptitude logical reasoning and herbal for the practice website you can check india bix website it is the very good website and book name is rs agrawal sir book youtube channel name is rastugi sir and online learning channel means we can also start the preparation for the tcs nqt soon and we have to prepare all the topic and we have done in 45 days of preparation because as we know that after 30 august the exam is scheduled for the 2022 batch okay for aptitude you can prefer the resources if i talk about python or java programming language so you can choose the python and java programming language it's totally depend on you because most of the candidates also done coding in c and c plus plus but if i talk about in python so the book name is learning python you can check the youtube channel and online website i prefer for the preference like w3 is called for the java you can just check the resources for java if i talk about dbms plus sql management it is very important for interview because in most of the interview the dbms and sql questions are also asked so you have to check the following resources for the dbms if i talk about sql resources you can check the w3 school website and java t point for the data structure and algorithm you can check the prefer rgb syllabus or your university syllabus and this is the youtube channels that you can prefer for the data structure and algorithm if i talk about object oriented programming so you can check the prefer rgb syllabus or you can check your uh you can check your university syllabus for object oriented programming because as we know that there is some coding or object oriented programming question and data structure question and advanced data structure question avl tree and b3 also so in the youtube channel asha kilrani mem channel all the topics are covered for the algorithm you can check the analysis and design of algorithm if i talk about programming practice so you can done your programming or practice programming on hacker rank hacker earth basic plus advanced programming lead code there are so many platform you can practice but if you done your practice in the right way so it will be very helpful for cracking the exam how to crack easily tcs and qt exam sorry for considering the final round because it is very same to nvtq exam also but how to crack easily how to crack easily tcs and qt exam how to practice coding question which coding platform is best for beginner can i start from hacker rank or hacker earth you can start from hacker rank this will totally depend on you if you are beginner you can check the questions on hacker rank and if you are advanced programmer so you can just uh solve the problem on hacker earth okay and all coding platform is very good you have to practice the coding question daily for solving the questions because it is the very important example okay so as you can see that array matrix string related questions is very important for cracking the tcs and qt exam what are what are some myth about tcs nqt exam because most of the candidates say that sir how to get the digital profile because most of the candidate target about the tcs not tcs ninja but most of the candidate also target about tcs digital okay so if i talk about tcs digital they will check your score and if they will give you interview opportunity so i think previously on the basis of your interview opportunity they will give you digital profile role okay it they will totally depend on tcs game what's your interview is going on but they will only say that they will hire for the tcs ninja role okay so this is the some important point that can you choose python because it is very easy and simple to code instead of java programming language so it's totally depend on you you can go with python also and you can go with java also whether you are comfortable in any of the programming language what about negative marking i think there is no negative marking in the tcs entity exam if i talk about remote or in center location so in center location is currently best not the currently best but if i say that in the upcoming month because in center have the proper way of giving the exam but in the remote condition it will also totally depend on you but in the remote condition if you not follow the rules and regulation properly so they withheld your result and there is some problem in hiring so you can choose on your way most of the candidates are choose remote center also there is no problem it will totally depend on you you can choose the remote also in center it will totally depend on you what about august and qt exam if i talk about august entity exam so i think they the august nqt exam and the free enquiry exam is totally different but let me know that what the tcs team said in the upcoming days for this because there is no uh confirmation news that what about august and qt examine free nqt exam because august 10 qt exam is for 2017 to 23 batch but the free nqt exam is only for 2022 batch okay so what next we have to start the preparation for the tcs and qt exam soon and we have to prepare the aptitude also programming also because it is very important i will use the very good approach to solve the problem if you want videos on specific preparation just drop your comment in the comment section it is very important okay if you have any queries regarding tcs nqt exam you can ask in the comment section or dm me in instagram i am regularly and my team

रहा था तो आप या तो यह बताओगे कि इस चीज मैं इसका एडवांटेजेस ऐसे है कि इसमें जो कुछ यह स्पेसिफिक लाइब्रेरीज़ है यह है हमें कि इजी एक चीज फैसिलिटी का हमें वह देती है मतलब एक ऐज देती है दूसरी दूसरी ड्राइवरी सिर्फ नंबर के ऊपर क्योंकि इसमें जो यह चीजें हैं वह इजी टू इंप्लिमेंट है प्लस इसमें यह एडवांटेज है आपको एडवांटेज पता होना चाहिए सीधी होती है आप यह कह सकते इसका यूज करके मुझे यह एडवांटेज मिला इसके एडवांटेज है वह आपको इस चीज में पता होना चाहिए यह चीज आपको यह क्वेश्चन बताएगा और यह चीज कैसे दूसरे के ऊपर अच्छी है खुद के भी एडवांटेज और दूसरे के ऊपर कैसे अच्छी वह भी चीज आपको पता होना चाहिए ठीक है तो इसलिए मैंने यह किया ऐसा न कि मेरे को यह चीज आती थी इसलिए मैंने कर दिया कोई हमसे पूछ सकता कि आपने इस ट्रैक को क्यों यूज किया तो आपको का है वह कि मुझे यही आता था इसलिए मैंने यूज किया नहीं आप उसके एडवांटेज बगैर पता होना चाहिए ठीक है तीसरी चीज डायग्राम बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है कि चोटी बड़ी कंपनियों नहीं पूछेंगे लेकिन अगर आपको रिटर्न की कंपनी में जाते हो आप अपने प्रोजेक्ट का स्लॉट डायग्राम पता होना चाहिए बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है क्या खोज प्रोजेक्ट कैसे फॉलो कर रहा है सबसे पहले अगर आपने लॉग इन ए सिस्टम बनाया तो आप ऐसे लिखोगे लॉगिन अगर आपको किसी भी टॉपिक पटेल वीडियो चाहिए बता देना बड़ा न कोई टेंशन वाली

ठीक है तो यह होता प्रोग्राम इस टाइप को आइडिया लग गया हुआ तो यह आपको प्रोजेक्ट में पता होना चाहिए कि आपका जो प्रोजेक्ट है वह पूरा टोटल कैसे प्रोसेस कर रहा था ठीक है तो यह चीज काफी ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट है ठीक है क्या था अपना तीसरा पॉइंट्स लौटाएगा है ना फील्ड डायग्राम यह बहुत ही इंपोर्टेंट है जाना ठीक है थे फोर चीज अगर आपने इस पर कोई पर्टिकुलर चीज यूज करें जैसे कि सपोच में एग्जांपल अगर आपने फेस्टिवल यूज

कि आप से पाइथन का कोड करा लिया जाएगा बजट का के भाई तुम वोट करके विदाउट नंबर प्लेट में क्या किया था नहीं ऐसा ही एक आया आपको उसकी फंक्शनैलिटी पता होना कि जैसे कि वह यह पूछ सकते हैं कि आपने प्रोजेक्ट में लिस्ट आफ नेमस क्वेस्टो करें ठीक है लैपटॉप लैपटॉप ने किस्म करे लैपटॉप मे तो आपने बता दिया कि भाई सपोज सपोच कि मैंने सेट में किए हैं ठीक है तो पूछ सकते हैं यार सेट में क्योंकि इस सेट में तो आपको पता है हर चीज यूनिक होती है ठीक है तो यह आपको एग्जांपल यह बता रहा हूं तो इसे ऐसे भी हो सकता है कि जैसे आपने इसमें आपको नेम सिस्टम करें इस प्रयोग तो आपने किस में किए हैं तो इस टाइप चाहिए पूछी जाएगी मोस्ट इंपोर्टेंट आपको थर्ड टिप्स ज्यादा प्रकट करना है ठीक है आप जो भी विजिट किया आप उसकी थे इरॉटिक चीजें सारी पता होनी चाहिए जैसे कि मैं आपको बताता हूं कि सपोच मेहनत प्रोजेक्ट बनाया कोई ठीक है मैंने मान लो प्रोजेक्ट बनाया उस मैंने कोई स्पेसिफिक चीज यूज करें है मतलब नोट जैसी यूज किया है ठीक है node.js का नोट जिस यूज किया है तो अब नोट जिससे पोर्शन पूछा जाता है सिग्नल थ्री डेज मल्टीथ्रेडेड है ठीक है यह चीज पूछेगा सकती है यह प्रेम व क्या है आपने यूज किया को पता होना चाहिए कि थ्रोट एक चीज है ठीक है नोट जैसे एक पर्टिकुलर रिलीफ फ्रॉम वर्क है या वे कैंट की एक लैंग्वेज है क्या है यह इस ठीक है नोट जिस को कहा कि पैकेजेस आपको कहां मिलते हैं ठीक है मैं इसी कुछ पर्टिकुलर कमांड पूछी जा सकती है तो कोई ट्रॉपिकल नॉलेज इसके पीछे होंगी बहुत जरूरी है ठीक है छठे भी चीज कि अगर आप एक पॉइंट कोई छोटा है जिसको आप ऐसा समझते हो तो उसको उसमें उर्स के क्लास और ऑब्जेक्ट में कनवर्ट किया जा सकता है तो आपको यह चीज भी रिपेयर करनी पड़ेगी जैसे आपसे पूछा जा सकता है कि आपने क्या बनाया ठीक है सपोच मैंने कहा कि भाई के भाई मैंने बना दिया मैंने क्या बनाया बैंकिंग सिस्टम जो मैंने बैंकिंग सिस्टम बना है ठीक है तो आप हमसे पूछ सकते हैं कि यार थोड़ी सी मुझे इसमें दो क्लास डिसाइड करके बता दूं कि आपने बैंकिंग सिस्टम बनाया तो आप बैंक

ठीक है तो ऑब्जेक्ट ओरिएंटेड डिजाइन में कंवर्ट करना आपको आना चाहिए ठीक है ए वेरी इंर्पोटेंट फॉर एक और मेरे हिसाब से जवाब इतनी चीजें रिपेयर कर लेते हो तो इसके बाद आप पर केवल एक क्वेश्चन और आ जाता है तो आप रिपेयर हो जाओ यह सारी है टेक्निकल चीजें ठीक है कि सबसे थे सेवंथ क्वेश्चन सबसे ज्यादा कुछ अधिकतर कहां है प्रोजेक्ट में ठीक है सबसे अच्छा आपको डिफिकल्टी क्या हुई ठीक है डिफिकल्टी क्या हुई और आपने उसको रेक्टिफायर कैसे किया कि यह क्वेश्चन यह लास्ट और सबसे इंपोर्टेंट क्वेश्चन इसको आपको पता होना चाहिए कि इस सेवा पर लेवल्स करेगा जैसे आपने कोई चीज बताई कि मैंने यह मॉडल एंप्लॉयमेंट किया उसने मुझे कुछ यह डिफिकल्ट ठीक है ठीक है तो उसने मुझे कहा कि यह मॉडल में एंट्री बैंक यह कट है उसे वापस लेवल्स करेगा यार यह तो बहुत छोटी सी इसमें इसको डिफिकल्ट लगा ठीक है तो मतलब आपके डिफिकल्टी का एक लेवल जानने के लिए आपको क्या चीज डिफिकल्ट लगे सही में वह किसी अच्छी चीज ठीक है कोई आप कोई बहुत बकवास चीज डिफिकल्ट बोल रहे हो तो यह चीज आपको एक प्रकार करके जानी है और जब आप इन 7 चीजों पर तय कर लेते हो ना कि आप

हेलो हेलो हेलो आज मैंने एक बहुत ही ज्यादा प्यारा क्वेश्चन सॉल्व किया इसी वजह से वो था न्यू कंपनीज फ्रॉम है करंट ठीक है तो इस क्वेश्चन को मैंने वन गो में सॉल्व किया है तो अब मैं आपको बताता हूं कि यह जो मैंने वन वूमेन सॉल्व किया तो मैंने कैसे सॉल्व किया मतलब मैंने क्या एप्रोच यूज करी मैं किसी क्वेश्चन को कॉल करने के लिए सोचता हूं मैं आपके विथ और प्रोसेस में डिवेलप करवाता हूं ठीक है तो इस साइट क्वेश्चन सबसे पहले मैं बता दूं कि कंपनियों के लिए बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है अगर मैं कहूं एक यह हार्ड लेवल का क्वेश्चन माना जाएगा कि आपके कंपनी के अगर आपके ऑनलाइन एसेसमेंट में आता है फिर किसी में भी आता है तो डाटा एंट्री बड़ी कंपनी में पूछे जा सकता है ठीक है इस क्वेश्चन आते हैं ठीक है तो आप देख लेते हैं क्वेश्चन क्या कह रहा है कंपनी चालू हो रही है जिसकी हार की कुछ ऐसी है सबसे पहले हम डराता है फिर लिस्ट में नजर आता है फिर सीनियर मैनेजर आखिर में नजर आता है हर एंड्राइड आता ठीक है इन सब कि आपको इंडिविजुअल टाइम इंडिविजुअल टेबल्स गिनी अज्ञान है ठीक है टेबल कितने गिवन है आपको सब सारी यह जो पोस्ट है इन सभी पोस्ट कि इंडिविजुअल ट्रेवल्स की गेहूं है अपन को आउटपुट में देना है क्या देना हुआ है को सबसे पहले कंपनी का कॉर्ड उसके फादर का नाम टर्न टोटल नंबर ऑफ लीड मैनेजर टोटल नंबर ऑफ सीनियर मैनेजर टोटल नंबर ऑफ मैनेजर यह देखो टोटल नंबर ऑफ मैनेजर टोटल नंबर आफ एम्पलाई एंड ऑर्डर करना है एसेंडिंग ऑर्डर बाय द कंपनी को ठीक है तो जब भी पीठ क्वेश्चन को चालू करो सबसे पहले आपको क्या चीज देखने क्या आपको प्रिंट क्या-क्या कराना है अगर आपने इतना काम सोच लिया का 40% क्वेश्चन है ठीक है तो सबसे पहले कहा था कि भाई कंपनी का कोड प्रिंट करा रहा है देखो इस क्वेश्चन में जब मल्टीप्ल टेबल्स गिवन होती है ना तो आप एक काम किया करो यह 12345 यह पांच और टेबल की ढिलाई बरतना बहुत जरूरी है क्योंकि कंफ्यूजन हो जाता है ठीक है तो पहला इस हम बनाएंगे पॉसिबल की अलग से ठीक है एलियास हमने बना दी फिर उसके बाद क्या करना है फुल टॉक प्रिंटर कंपनी कोड तो कंपनी कोर्ट सबसे पहले मिल जाएंगे इस लैटर लिए हमने कंपनी को डॉक्टर का नाम कर लेंगे फिर टोटल नंबर ऑफ लीड मैनेजर यह सीनियर मैनेजर निकालना इसलिए उनको माउंट लगाना पड़ेगा ठीक है एक चीज हमें क्लियर हो गए तो सबसे पहले हमने क्या किया सबसे पहले हमने पर टेबल देखी तो हमारी टेबल कुछ ऐसी हुई है अब हमें कंपनी को डिटेल्स मिल आज हम टेबल देख सकते हैं कंपनी के इसमें लिखा हुआ है तब कोड ऑफ कंडक्ट तो दो चीजें हमें इससे मिल जाएगी तो कंपनी के डायरेक्टर ठीक है तो मैं आपको लाइन बहन एक्सप्लेन करता हूं कैसे चलेंगे तो मैंने लिखा सिलेक्ट सीड कंपनी को और ज़ीरो फ़िगर ठीक है यह चीज में मिल गई अब ठीक है अब दो चीज हमारी सिलेक्ट हो चुकी है क्लियर उसको भूल जाओ ठीक है क्या कि हमें इस लैटर लिए कंपनी को हो गया भाई फाउंडर हो गया अब कह रहा है टोटल नंबर ऑफ लीड मैनेजर्स अगर आप ऑब्जर्व करोगे टोटल नंबर ऑफ लीड मैनेजर हम कैसे निकाले हैं सबसे पहले आप जाओ लीड मैनेजर वाली टेबल पर वन विभाग है लीड मैनेजर वाली टेबल ठीक है तो हमारे पास है कंपनी कुल है कंपनी को डेसपोटिज्म सीवन के लिए चल रहे हैं तो हम देख सकते हैं सीवन के लीड मैनेजर कितना है एक है ठीक है तो सिंपल सी चीजें हम चेक कर लेंगे जो भी हमने कंपनी कोड सेलेक्ट किया है उसके लिए जितनी भी लीड मैनेजर है उनको अकाउंट करो लेकिन अकाउंट कैसे करेंगे हम डिस्टिंग अलग-अलग चाहिए हमें एक ही कुमार और बहू नहीं करना चाहते हैं ठीक है और सिंपल जो इसको भी हम डिस्ट्रिक्ट करके कूट कर लेंगे ठीक है अगली चीज बताओ अगले चीज क्या कि और अगली चीज है टोटल नंबर ऑफ सीनियर मैनेजर ठीक है अब सीनियर मैनेजर की टेबल पर गए थे 111 आप देख रहे हैं स्टेप बाय स्टेप आगे बढ़ो एक बीच पड़ता जो कि वह क्या पूछ रहा है सीनियर मैनेजर से कंपनी कोड सीमन है तो सैन्य शिविर में हम देख सकते हैं यह दो सीनियर मैनेजर लैब इनोवेशन के तो हमें से कूट कर लेंगे ठीक है 80 मैनेजर अकाउंट करना है मैनेजर के लिए उसी वन चेक करेंगे तो यह मैनेजर है सीवन में हमने देखा एम्पलाई चेक करेंगे और यह तो एंपलॉयर है तो ऐसे हम कहां कमेंट करके अपनी सिंपल सी चीज है हमारा क्वेश्चंस और हो जाएगा कई बच्चे के होते हैं कितने बड़े क्वेश्चन देखिए कंट्री जाते हैं क्या करना है अब यह जो नार्मल बेसिक है उन्हें मत बोलो ठीक है अब मैं आगे चलता हूं कुछ आपको बताता हूं कि इसमें क्या चीज इंपोर्टेंट है तो मैं लिखा सिलेक्ट सॉफ्टवेयर कंपनी कोर्ट co-founder डिस्ट्रिक्ट एंड नॉट लीड मैनेजर को ठे कैन लीड मैनेजर पोर्ट जैसे मैं आपको एक एक्सप्लेन करता हूं से हमें मालूम लीड मैनेजर अकाउंट कर रहा है ठीक है लीड मैनेजर तो हम क्या चेक करेंगे इस कंपनी कॉर्ड जो सीमन है यह वाला कंपनी कोर्स में कितने लीटर में नजर रखना है एक लीड मैनेजर देखा तो हमने लिखा अकाउंट डिस्टिक लीड मैनेजर को ठीक है टेबल बा लेंगे ठीक है पहले से सिलेक्ट स्टेटमेंट चल रहा है तो यह हो गया सिस्टम मैनेजर कोड एंप्लॉयर को ठीक है अपने सारे ही यह कमेंट कर लें यहां पर अपना काम फिनिश है और उनको सारी डिटेल का नाम लेना पड़ेगा तो मैं लिखा फ्रॉम कंपनी से अब यह जो अलार्म्स है यह बनाना बहुत जरूरी है लीड मैनेजर ऑयल सीनियर मैनेजर एसएस मैनेजर एंप्लोई क्योंकि इससे क्या कंफ्यूजन नहीं आएगा ठीक है कंफ्यूजन नहीं होगा यह बहुत जरूरी है वरना पास अब हरिशंकर गलत हो जाएगा अब हम क्या करेंगे नार्मल जॉइंट कर देंगे एक को दूसरे से जुड़ जाएंगे हम नॉर्मली जानते हैं कैसे करते हैं तो मैं लिखना व यहां से चालू करूंगा मैं फेस्टिवल से अगर इसका कंपनी कोल्ड लीड मैनेजर कंपनी कोटी-बावर देखो अब जैसे मामलों हमें सीवन के लिए उठाना है तो सबसे पहले हम उठाएं सीवन के लिए तो हमने देखी क्या है कंपनी कंपनी हैं अपनी C1 121 कंपनी कोर्ट कैसी वन कंपनी केवल सबसे पहले हमने उठाया सीवन अब हम चेक करेंगे कि मैनेजर हमें इसमें चेक करना सीवन मुझे करना है तो हमने लीड मैनेजर को भी सीवन में चेक किया तो हम क्या कहना है कि इसका सेवन इस प्रतिबंध के बराबर होना चाहिए तो हमने ठीक है उठा लिया फिर हम कह कि इसका सेवन अगर इसके सेवन के बराबर जो सीनियर मैनेजर तो उनको कूट कर लो फिर इसका सेवन इसके सीवन के बराबर तो उसका कंट्रोल ऐसे करके मारा पूरा ज्वाइन होता चला जाएगा ठीक है तो हमने भी लिखा आ सीड कंपनी को डैड कंपनी कोड नजर कोड वर्ड है दो डिजिट मैनेजर को ऐसे करते करते हैं लांच किया अब हम अपने बेसिक्स कभी नहीं बोलना है ठीक है क्योंकि देखिए हमने अकाउंट किया है ग्रुप लगाना पड़ेगा और बारे में जो इंपोर्टेंट चीज है वह यह है कि सिलेक्ट स्टेटमेंट हम जो भी लिखते हैं वह हमारे ग्रुप में होना चाहिए तो मैं लेकर सिलेक्ट सीट कंपनी को डॉट सीओ डॉट पावडर तो ग्रुप है मैं भी मैं लिखूंगा सीड कंपनी को रोड व जो यह चीज है वह सेमी होनी चाहिए बेसिक है यह आपको पता होना चाहिए अगर आपको बेसिक है कुशल कर दोगे और ऑर्डर करना लास्ट कि कंपनी को राहत मिलेगी और 889 कंपनी कोर्ट तो ऐसे क्वेश्चन सॉल्व हो चुका है तो इसमें मेरा कोई भी एक चीज उसने कई बिल्कुल बेसिक यूज करें क्या करना है मैं स्टेप बाय स्टेप क्वेश्चन है बढ़ना है पूरा क्वेश्चन को सर्च करोगे सबमिट करोगे सबमिट हो जाएगा तो यह था यह क्वेश्चन न्यू कंपनीज आफ है चेक कर सके और कैरियर पर डिस्क्रिप्शन में मिल जाएगी थैंक यू

Awesome Explanation. Just want to know about the Join you used which join it is ? what does this Join do? I am confused with the syntax. Like in Left Join==[ From Table A Left Join Table B On Col1=Col2 ] . Can we use 'On' in place of 'Where' vice versa.
Thanks
By the way nice explanation 👏👏
after where you can just use only company_code to merge all.....and no use of order by even (here)
please help me with the group by clause you have written. As far as I know group by clause groups rows based on certain column. So why are we writing c.founder? it should be group by c.company_code? i dont get it please reply soon?
there is a better way to do this without using all the tables. We can just use company table and employee table as employee table contains all the data we need .
Query -- 
SELECT c.company_code,c.founder,
    count(distinct e.lead_manager_code),
    count(distinct e.senior_manager_code),
    count(distinct e.manager_code),
    count(distinct e.employee_code)
FROM company as c, employee as e
WHERE c.company_code = e.company_code 
 GROUP BY c.company_code,c.founder
 ORDER BY c.company_code
can someone explain why we are using group by here
sir bohot gazab style hai apka explain karneka.
Great explanation with basics, Thanks 👍
Why it's showing error
great explanation
It was a very well explained and great solution! Thanks!

Transcript:
यह हलवा 100 आज हम फूड कोर्ट का रिव्यू करने वाले ऑलरेडी हम एप्लाइड कई राज्यों की वेब डेवलपमेंट कोर्स का और साथ ही साथ एक मशीन लर्निंग उसका मशीन लर्निंग ए टू जेड कोर्स का रिव्यु कर सकते हैं ठीक है f4 से होने वाला रिव्यू सीरीज में तो अब देखते हैं तो यह आप देख सकते हो यह परचेस दिस को सॉल्व दिसंबर 27 2010 में ऑलरेडी इसको परचेस कर के पढ़ चुका हूं तो मैं आपको यह रिव्यु कर रहा हूं ठीक है तो कोर्स फ्रॉम हंड्रेड्स आफ कोर्ट तक कंप्लीट पाइथन प्रॉब्लम कैंप फॉर ट्वेंटी ट्वेंटी वन टी एक्ट मास्टर पाइथन बाय बिल्डिंग खंडहर प्रोजेक्ट्स इन हेज़ ठीक है चलो समझते हैं इसके बारे में और मैं एक ही वन आपको हर चीज डिटेल्स में बताऊंगा सबसे पहले बात करते कोर्स इंस्ट्रक्टर की रेंज अलाइव तो जब मैंने वेब डेवलपमेंट का कोर्स किया था वह मैंने काफी पहले लिया था उसके बाद मेरे पैटर्न रिकॉर्ड प्रियंका और आप सोचो कि मुझे इंस्पेक्टर पसंद आई होगी तभी मैंने एक्सट्रेक्ट है दूसरा कुंभ लिए ठीक है इंस्ट्रक्टर बॉयज लव यूजर बेस सिस्टम में को कभी इनकी मतलब बढ़ाने में से एक निशान लगाएं क्वाई नहीं लगी है मुझे काफी अच्छा लगता बढ़ाने का स्टाइल तो इंस्ट्रक्टर वापिस तो फूल और फल कोई भी दिक्कत नहीं है मुझे काफी ज्यादा पसंद है ठीक है तब बात करने पर बात कर लेते हैं कोर्स के स्ट्रक्चर की कोर्स कैसा है और सबसे ज्यादा जो डाट आता है इस कोर्स को करके क्या जॉब मिल सकती है उसके बारे में हम देख लेंगे ठीक है तो ए हार्ड डिस्क हिसाब से ही पोस्टेड है अगर मैं बिल्कुल बेसिक वेतन से स्टार्ट करो तो आपको बेसिक उसे पैटर्न वहां से भाग गई है ठीक है पूरी पाइथन है कोई टेंशन वाली बात यह काफी प्रैक्टिस भी कराई गई यह टॉपिक पर तो उसमें कोई ऐसा ही बेसिक पेंशन जल्दी ही कि जायेगी ठीक है तो यह सब कुछ चला जाएगा उस आपको बढ़िया सिखाया है ठीक है तो उसके लेवल तक हम आ गए तो यहां पर कूड़ा उठाने वाली बिल्कुल परफेक्ट चीज अगर आप अच्छे से पढ़ोगे तो आपकी पैटर्न पर अच्छी ग्राफ पक्के पर होने वाली है ठीक है यह चालू करते हैं उसके बाद अब आपको शहद जीव ग्राहक यूजर इंटरफेस जो चीज इतनी पॉपुलर तो नहीं है बट आपको सिखाई गई है 100 को कि आपकी स्किन व इन्हें करेगी और अक्षर से भाग गई है तो कोई दिक्कत वाली बात नहीं अच्छा सिखाया गया एनिमेशन अगर आपको सिखाया गया है कोई दिक्कत वाली बात नहीं है सब अच्छा सिखाया गया है फिर यहां पर रीडिंग राइटिंग फाइल वर्किंग विद सीएसपी बिल्कुल सब चीज बिल्कुल परफेक्ट मतलब में एक जगह को बुराई नहीं निकाल सकता हूं यह सारी चीजें परफेक्ट हुए धज्जियां उड़ाई होगी वह मैं आपको तो फिर ठीक इन ट्रकों से आईटी कैन ट्रेक अच्छी स्किल है सीखने के लिए कोई लोगे इंटर भी कहते हैं ठीक है तो यह जो आपको सिखाया गया यह बढ़िया लेवल का दिखाया गया मतलब मैं सही बताऊं तो काफी अच्छे दिल लेवल पर बना पाए इसके बाद अगर आप प्रैक्टिस करते हो जाएगी वहीं प्रोग्राम्स तो इसमें भी कोई शिकायत नहीं है ठीक है आपको हर चीज वगैरह यह सब चीजों से भागे है ठीक है कोई दिक्कत नहीं है यह सवा सही है फिर आपको एपीआई वजह से भाग गई है कि आप यह जो एप्लीकेशन प्रोग्रामिंग इंटरफेस होता है आप उसका कैसे यूज कर सकते हो तो आप ही वाले पोर्शन में क्या होता है चलिए का एक कोड बना हुआ होता है हम जस्टिस का यूज करते हैं आपके समझ लो तो वह चीज होती है तो यह जो इसको सिखाई गई है उसको आप मतलब अब यह समझो आप एक्सटेंड कर के अपने प्रोजेक्ट सेक्शन में भी मेंशन कर सकते हो और आपने थोड़ा सा कुछ अच्छा प्रोजेक्ट इसके ऊपर बना लिया तो इसमें भी मुझे कोई शिकायत नहीं है ठीक है तो यह सब को अच्छा सिखाया गया है अब देखो मींस जाते हैं अगर आप स्पोर्ट्स सपोर्ट करो कि अगर आपने गूगल पीड़ा को सह सकता है ठीक है तो आखिरी चीज रिपीट सीटें मिलने वाली यह चीज में क्लियर करना चाहता हूं कि जो एचटीएमएल सीएसएस और यहां पर का आगे बूटस्ट्रैप तब सेक्शन होगा 5 घंटे का तो वह चीज रिपेयर टिप्स है जो वेब डेवलपमेंट वाले में वीडियो है सीएम वीडियो से इसमें भी है तो क्या उसको रिपीट करना ठीक था हमे हिसाब से ठीक था क्योंकि मतलब इस कोर्स में कि आपको प्लांट भी सिखाया गया है तो वह बैक एंड है उससे पहले आपको फ्रंट डोर सिखा नहीं था तो यह चीजें रिपीट यह मैं आपको पहले ही पनाह घर भेड ऐड कर सकते हैं तो आप इंटरनेशनल है वहीं वीडियो आ गई ठीक है कि रैपिड स्ट्रैप कोई दिक्कत वाली बात नहीं है ठीक है वेब स्क्रेपिंग अगर आपको दिखाई गई है अब यह चीज है वेब स्क्रेपिंग है हां मैं तो ठीक से खाइए मतलब यह आप यहां से चीजें एडवांस एक्सपेक्ट नहीं कर सकते थे कि दो सैलरी हमें या फिर ब्यूटीफुल सुपर खुद में काफी बड़े-बड़े वास्तु पर हैं एडम्स गया है वह टाइपिंग के लिए तो खुद में काफी बढ़िया एक टूल है ठीक है तो आप इतना बड़ा उसको एक्सपेक्ट नहीं कर सकते हैं यह बहुत बड़ा आपको सिखाया गया होगा तो यहां से मैं बताता हूं आपको तो यह नॉर्मल नॉर्मल आप पर कह सकते सिखाया गया है कि आपका बेसिक्स क्लियर हो जाएंगे ठीक है उसके बाद आपको मेन जिससे का बताता हूं कई लोग यह चीजें नहीं पड़ते हैं तो वह मैं उन्हें बताता हूं कि यह जो साइड में लिखा है ना सीमेंट एडमिट यह वीडियोस नहीं है जैसे कि यह जॉब एप्लीकेशन पोट बनाना लिंक्डइन पर और प्रिंटर स्वाइपिंग वोट यह सब चीजें इनका डॉक्यूमेंटेशन दिया है ठीक है आपको वीडियोस के थ्रू एक्सप्लेन नहीं है तो यह चीज में को लेकर मजा आता हूं हो सकता है कई लोगों को यह बात पसंद है कि डिफिकल्ट काफी ज्यादा बड़ा हो जाता अगर हर चीज वीडियो की तरह नहीं जाती है तो डॉक्यूमेंटेशन दिया काफी अच्छा वेल मेंटेंड है तो आप उसको पर हैं आसानी से बना पाओगे को क्वारी बात नहीं है ठीक है तो यह सब कुछ सिखाया गया है आगे चलते हैं फिर प्लास्टिक प्लास्टिक अगर मैं कहूं तो आप बहुत ज्यादा एक्सपेक्टेशन मत लगा के रखना कि आप देखने में बहुत खड़े होने वाले हो चुप लास्ट वाला सेक्शन है ओके ओके पढ़ाया गया बिल्कुल आपको बेसिक सेट अप वगैरह करना छोटी-मोटी चीजें आपको समझ में आ जाएंगे ठीक है तो ज्यादा एक्सपेक्ट इस जगह पर मत करना पाइथन की जो बेसिक होते हैं उससे आपका फेस सेलेक्ट कर सकते हो बहुत-बहुत अच्छी लग पड़ा है ठीक है तो यह आपको प्लांट भी ऐसा नहीं है कि मैं यह बिल्कुल एक अच्छा सा बेसिक पर आकर छोड़ दिया पढ़ना अच्छा पढ़ा है मतलब अगर आप लेकिन अगर आपको बहुत ज्यादा मजबूत करना था वह उससे भी पढ़ना पड़ेगा पर लव ओनली या कोई ट्रीटमेंट ओके ऐसा नहीं है ट्रैक्शन से किया और मैं मास्टर हो जाऊंगा इसमें ठीक है तो वह चीज नहीं है ठीक है फिर बूटस्ट्रैप का यह जो पॉइंट है यह सेक्शन ऑर का रिपिटेटिव फिर ठीक है फिर यह जो प्रोजेक्ट से आप देख सकते हो यह सारे डॉक्यूमेंटेशन दिया हुआ है ठीक है यह पढ़ाई नहीं गई यह डॉक्यूमेंटेशन तो आप यह चीज दिमाग क्लियर रखना ठीक है कि यह भी रैपिड है उसके बाद रेस्टफुल अपी वगैरह मतलब छोटे छोटे पोर्शन है मतलब यह कह सकता हूं कि कोर्स का कंटेंट बनाने के लिए डॉक्यूमेंटेशन ज्यादा है वीडियोस लेकर फ्लैग कम इसमें मतलब ऐसा आप समझ सकते विशेष ठीक है इतना कुछ एडवांस बस फ्लिप नहीं मिलेगा साउथ एक्शन रीप्ले से सीख सकते हो ठीक है कि उसे टिकेश्वर आफ है आपको सिखाया गया है ठीक है और उसके बाद डिप्लॉयमेंट हाथों से उठाया गया अच्छी बातें काफी को इस कोर्स में दूसरी बात जो लोग इस कोर्स यह फट सोच क्या रहे हो यार इसमें आपको डाटा एडवांस इस बीच सीखने को मिलेगा पांडा से मेट्रो रूट से तो यह आपकी गलतफहमी है न केवल इस पोर्शन को टच किया गया काफी बड़ा इस मुकुंद सैफ डाटा एनएसएस वाला तो आप एक्सेप्ट मत करना कि आप डाटा एनालिसिस पूरा सीख जाओगे आप बिल्कुल बेसिक टच करोगे बेसिक भी प्रश्न नहीं करोगे मतलब बिल्कुल हल्का सा आप समझो तो ऐसा कुछ है बाकी कुछ प्रोजेक्ट्स एंड डॉक्यूमेंटेशन दिया गया है वह काफी अच्छे ठीक है मतलब बहुत अच्छी लेवल पर उसका डॉक्यूमेंटेशन में बताऊंगा प्रोजेक्ट भी अच्छे हैं वहां पर जो में आसानी से मेंशन कर सकते हैं ठीक है तो यह बात हो गई लिनियर रिग्रेशन बराबर यह मैं बता रहा हूं कि आप टच कर लोगे सही पढ़ाया मतलब मैं क्या बताऊं अगर अब मैं आपको बताने वाला हूं कि यह कहना पर्टिकुलर पाइथन पैक ओर से यह फील्ड खुद में काफी बड़ी फील है तो इसमें अगर आपको बहुत अच्छे से सीखना कुछ एक्स्ट्रा बिल्कुल वगैरह करना पड़ेगा बिल्कुल बेसिक्स आफ है इसमें टच किए रहे इतना अच्छा का कांसेप्ट क्लीयर नहीं होगा विटामिन ए smile-filled डे ठीक है चलो यह भी समझ में आ गई फिर आप यह प्रोजेक्ट प्रोजेक्ट साइन के डॉक्यूमेंटेशन अगर आपको यह दिए गए हैं और फिर यह लास्ट में प्रोटेक्शन तेरी है तो अब इस कोर्स की ओवरऑल में बात कर लेता हूं ओवर में बात करूं जो प्रोस्पेक्टिव राशि और रोग और बात कर लो कोर्स बहुत अच्छा कोड से पैटर्न के बेसिक जो ग्राफ पर बहुत सही होने वाले मैं एक चीज मत लेकर दूं अगर आप किसी जॉब में जाते हो तो आपकी प्रॉब्लम मतलब मैं 22 साइड में डिवाइड करना चाहता हूं एक सर्विस कंपनी हटाई तो मैं कहना चाहूं प्रोडक्ट बेस कंपनी और स्टार्टअप ठीक है अगर आप स्टार्टअप्स पर जाते हो तो आपकी डेवलपमेंट स्किल काफी जांच की जाती है तो आपको किसी एक चीज के साथ अच्छा होना चाहिए पैटर्न के साथ हो सकता है वेब डेवलपमेंट में काफी अच्छी हो डेफिनेशन आफ डाटा नजर इसमें करें तो बेसिक तो मुझे करेंगे तो यह बेसिक तो आपके बहुत अच्छे से क्लियर होने वाले हैं वे डेवलपमेंट वगैरह थोड़ा-बहुत सीख जाओगे फिर बाद में को प्रैक्टिस करनी पड़ेगी और प्रोजेक्ट व देखेंगे तो आप किसी स्टार्टअप में जॉब लगा सकते हो यह करके मैंने आपको बता दिया बेसिक है ठीक है डेवलपमेंट बी है लेकिन थोड़ा को एक्सटर्नल पढ़ना पड़ेगा कुछ चीजें ठीक है तो आपका हो जाएगा सेक्शन प्रोडक्ट बेस कंपनी में मैं कहूंगा कि लैंग्वेज मैटर नहीं करती है यार सीरियसली को पायरेसी को कुछ भी हो प्रॉब्लम सॉल्विंग ध्यान दिया जाता है तो उसके लिए ऐसा कुछ हेल्पफुल नहीं होने वाला क्योंकि यहां पर डाटा स्ट्रक्चर्स देखे जाते हैं डाटा स्ट्रक्चर्स दिए से मैं अपनी स्किल देख कि तो वहां पर चला ऐसा कुछ खास हेल्पफुल नहीं होने वाला ठीक है अगर आप किसी स्टार्ट हम ग्राम या किसी स्किल ओरियंटेड जॉब होती है जैसे के बे डेवलप्ड चाहिए फ्रंट एंड डेवलपर एंड डेवलपर ठीक है इस तरीके को राज्यों में जाकर किसी स्टार्टअप में तो बेशक आप इसको करके जा सकते हो कि उम्र और अगर आप पैटर्न सीखना चाहते हो कोर्स बहुत शानदार बस सुनाई को आपको चीजें क्लियर हुई होंगी सो थैंक्यू दिस इज द रिव्यू बोट्स को स्विच ऑन

हेलो हेलो हेलो आज की वीडियो में बात करेंगे युवाओं की वायर मींस अर्ंस्ट ऐंड यंग ठीक है तो इस कंपनी की बात करेंगे तो सिमिलर नहीं हम पहले डिवाइस जॉब की पिक फॉर में आती है उसका भी हम पूरा आपको पैटर्न और पूरा सिलेबस बता चुके हैं आज हम बात करेंगे यानि कि जैसे कि मैं विवाह विवाह विवाह में दो आती है एक है यह इंडिया ठीक है 2 एंड टियर आती है यह इंडिया और एक है युवा जीनियस ठीक है तो आज हम बात कर रहे हैं वह इसकी कर रहे हैं आज हम बात कर रहे हैं व जीनियस की ठीक है इस वाले की बात कर रहा है यह इंडिया की बात नहीं कर रहा है ठीक है तो यह जिस की बात कर रहा तो यह जीडीएस का पूरा प्रोफेसर बनने वाले देखते हैं कि क्या होता है तो सबसे पहले मैं आपको बता रहा था इसमें आप फिट कर तीन होने वाले हैं अच्छा ठीक है 3 लाख होंगे अब तीन और जब मैं बात करूं तो सबसे पहला जो होता है वह नॉर्मली बेनिफिट राउडी होता है वहीं अगर होगा इसमें इससे हमे टर्न ओन कहते हैं ठीक है एटीट्यूट ब्राउन हो गया सेकंड होता है आपस में टेक्निकल ठीक है में 310 में चार ठीक है ठीक है यह वास्तव में संजय वैलिडिटी आफ है अरे बेटी रेडियो एलिजिबल कौन होगा देखो अब इसमें जो एलिजिबिलिटी की बात है तो इन्हें जीडीएस एक काफी ब्रॉड स्तर पर हायरिंग करती है तो उसमें मैं कहूंगा कि बीटेक ठीक है बीटेक ई एम सी एल अच्छा ठीक है कि बीसीए में बीएससी सारे रहते ठीक है है लेकिन पोस्टेड वर्कर जाती है ठीक है पोस्ट डिफ़ाल्ट कर जाती है जब मैं बात करूंगा लेकिन लगे जो हायरिंग जो आपका जो इंटरव्यू का लेवल होगा वह लगी से उस सेम ही होगा थोड़ा सा ऊपर नीचे हो जाता है ठीक है तो बीटा कि जब मैं बात करूं तो यह के असोसिएट केवल पर शेयर करती है ठीक है यह वाली है करती है असोसिएट के लेवल पर असोसिएट के लेवल पर और जब मैं बी और एमसीए भी ठीक है बीसीए बीएससी व करूं एक इनका आपको इंटरनल चीज होता तो इनका होता है टेक्नोलॉजी अरेस्ट ठीक है पैथोलॉजी रख की स्पीड पर साइड यह हायर करती है बीसीए और बीएससी को ठीक है तो यह जनरली समझ में आ गई पैटर्न आपका यही रहेगा ठीक है लेकिन क्या होता है कि इसलिए इस चीज का यह जो टेक्निकल राहुल है इसका लेवल भर जाता है यहां पर बीटेक में ठीक है और एमसीए ठीक है तो बस यही डिफरेंस ज्यादा कुछ डिफरेंस है नहीं अगर आप दोनों की स्टूडेंट तो आप अप्लाई करके हम इस वीडियो को देख सकता है ठीक है अगर मैं सबसे पहले एप्टिट्यूट टेस्ट को थोड़ा सा ग्रीस करना चाहूंगा वनवास सारे राइट को लेंगे तो हम सबसे पहले बात कर रहे हैं राइड वन की जो या उनका एटीट्यूड ठीक है तो इसमें अगर मैं आपको भी करूं तो ऐसा कुछ होने वाला आपके साथ हैं अच्छा ठीक है आपकी जो इंग्लिश है मैं इंग्लिश में आप देखेंगे 12 क्वेश्चन 8 मिनट्स ठीक है क्वांटिटी में लेंगे 12 मैं तुम्हारा करता हूं यार कुछ गलती हो गई है कि अ यह देखो आ है तो इंग्लिश में बार क्वेश्चन एस्टिमेट्स फॉर निभाएंगे बारक वैली मिनट्स प्रोजेक्ट में 12 कक्षा 12 मिनट कंप्यूटर प्रोग्रामिंग हमसे जीवन के बीच क्वेश्चन 20 मिनट और सिचुएशनल स्ट्रैंथ आफ बच्चन 20 मिनट तो ऐसा कुछ आपका एयरप्लेन मोड ऑन होने वाला ठीक है तो आप इसको थोड़ा और इसमें इससे जो आपका इंग्लिश काले बनाएगा वह आपका मैं कहूंगा इजी टू मीडियम आने वाला है इजी टू मीडियम जरा कुछ हार्ड नहीं आती है इजीलि आप कर पाओगे पॉइंट भी आपका इजी आएगा ठीक है कि ज्यादातर डिलाइट के से अगर मैं इसकी तुलना करूं तो डिवाइड कर थोड़ा सा हाथ ज्यादा होता है इसका Raees जाता है ठीक है क्योंकि उसका भी मेन भी समय दो पोषण इसमें जाता है ठीक है लॉजिकल भी पीठ रहने वाली है इंग्लिश आतिशबाजी मीडिया तक जा सकती है ठीक है कंप्यूटर प्रोग्रामिंग और एमसीक्यू क्वेश्चन बनाकर इसमें खुद सी प्लस प्लस जावा फेस्टिवल और नेटवर्किंग और इसके क्वेश्चन मिल सकते हैं ठीक है है तो इसमें युवराज सेक्शन है यह भी आपका अगर आपके कोर्स सब्जेक्ट बेसिक नॉलेज क्लियर तो आप इसको कनेक्ट कर पाओगे ठीक है सिचुएशनल स्ट्रैंथ तो आपके ऊपर है आपको काफी सिचुएशन ट्राफी दी जाएगी उस पर आपसे कुछ पूछा जाएगा तो आपको क्या करना है आपको स्वस्थ यौन के सामने वाला ठीक है तो यह कुछ प्रसिद्ध होने वाला एपिसोड शूट का अगर मैं ओवरऑल बात करूं तो यह जो एटीट्यूड होता है वह कंपेरटिवली कीजिए होता है मतलब इसका कटऑफ इतना ज्यादा ही नहीं जाता वह उसका रिजल्ट घोषित हो सकता है कि मैं यह कहूं कि इसमें जो बीसीए बीएससी वाले बच्चे हैं बीते पहले बच्चे हैं वह सर्विस कंपनी में अप्लाई कर रहे हैं तो मैं थोड़ी होता के अंदर कंप्यूटर प्रोग्रामिंग इतनी अच्छी नहीं होती है आप इस जगह पर स्ट्रांग है इन ट्वेंटी क्वेश्चन अभी यह तीन दो नार्मल सब कर लेते अगर आप इस जगह थोड़े से फ्रॉम है तो आपको हर चीज मिलेगी और आप ट्रैक कर लोगे ठीक है अज्ञेय डिसाइडिंग फैक्टर बन जाता है उसमें अ के प्रति ज्यादा समझ में आ गई तो ठीक है अब सेकंड लास्ट में जितने भी टेक्निकल डैड है तो देखो टेक्निकल राइड कि जब मैं बात करूं तो इसका थोड़ा सा अलग टाइप का होता है मतलब जब हम लेकर निकट की बाजू से काफी अच्छा लगे तो टेक्निकल रावण में क्या था इसमें कोई भी आपसे एक हिस्ट्रीशीटर है कोई क्वेश्चन नहीं

उच्चारण करके देखते हैं कि कुछ श्रवण कर रहा है तो अगर मैं इसको रन कर लूंगा है तो आप देख सकते हो सबसे पहले यह क्रोमड्राइवर डॉट एस सी खुलेगा आपका और इसको खुलने के बाद आप देखना इसको सिलने के बाद अपने क्रोम भी खुलेगा तो आप यह देख सकते हो यह क्रोम खुल चुका है हमारा को अप्रूव में हमने जॉन सी वेबसाइट डालनी है ड्राइवर काटना भूखे जाएगी आप साथ यहां पर पढ़ सकते हो कि क्रोम उस बीन कंट्रोल्ड बाय ऑटोमेटिक टेस्ट सॉफ्टवेयर आपको लिखकर मिलेगा अभी जो Chrome है वह अ एक्चुली एक ऑटोमेटिक सॉफ्टवेयर मतलब हमारे सेलेनियम से कंट्रोल हो रहा है ठीक है तो इतना कोड लिखने पर हमें यह मिल जाएगा हमारी वेबसाइट खुल चुकी है हमें जैसे अपना को ट्रेंड किया ठीक है चलो यह बात मैं समझ में आ गई अब हमें ऑटोमेट करना है अब ऑटोमेट करना है तो ऑटोमेटिकली हम क्या करना पड़ेगा यूजर नेम डालना पड़ेगा पासवर्ड डालना पड़ेगा ठीक है तभी हम ऑटोमेटिक हत्याओं से लॉगिन पर क्लिक करना है तो अब हम आएगी प्रोसेस सकते हैं तो अपन को क्या करना है अपन को यह देखना है कि अपन को डालना यहां से पहले अमन को सबसे बड़ा है यूजर नेम है तो यूजर नेम आप कैसे डाल सकते हैं वह मैं आपको बताता हूं ठीक है अब हम देखते हैं कि यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड बन कैसे कल करेंगे अब है तो एक्चुअली बहुत ही इजी है अपन को थोड़ा सा एचटीएमएल सीएसएस का ज्ञान होना चाहिए तो ओपन कर सकते तो मैं क्या करूंगा सबसे पहले यहां पर क्लिक करके यहां पर इंस्पेक्टर क्लिक कर दूंगा ठीक है तो हमें यह उस जगह है कोर्ट पर ले जाएगा जिससे यह आप देख सकते हो यह टेक्सटबॉक्स बनाया गया है ठीक है है तो देखो यह मुकुट पर ले गया इंस्पेक्टर पर मैंने जैसे क्लिक किया तो आप देख सकते हो यह हमारा कोड है ठीक है अब इसको पर जरा देखो इसको पर देखो यह वाला जो हमारा कुल है यहां पर यूजर नेम डालना है वह इसको हाईलाइट कर रहा है मतलब यहां से हमारे यूजर नेम टलेगा इसको से ठीक है 200 काफी सारे बेर होते हैं काफी करीबी होते हैं आपको एक्चुअली से लेट्यूस खा रहा हूं मैं आपको यह इस लाइन से कराह मैं आपको एक में बता रहा हूं कि हम इस चीज करेक्शन करना चाहते हैं यहां पर मैं यूजर नेम डालना था कैसे कर सकते हैं आप देख सकते हो कि इस टैग में हमारे पास नेम दिया हुआ है नेम है यूजर नेम ठीक है तुम किस का इस्तेमाल करेंगे हम नेम कस्टमर करेंगे यह जो यह हमारा आप बॉक्स देख रहे हो जहां पर मैं डालना है वह इस कोड के अंदर है जिसका नेम जो है वह यूजर नेम ठीक है इसका नाम क्या है यूजर नेम ठीक है यह वास्तव में समझ में आ गई इसका नेम या यूजर नेम तो हम यहां से इसको एक्सट्रेक्ट कर सकते हैं ठीक है मैला कोई भी में एक्शन करना हो तो मैं इस यूजर नेम हम यह बता देंगे कि आप इस पूरे वेबसाइट के कोर्ट पर सर्च करो और जहां पर भी आपको नेम इक्वल टू यूजर नेम मिल जाए वहां पर हम जो एक्शन कराना चाहिए हम अपना यूजर नेम डलवाना चाहते हैं वह डालो ठीक है तो यह ऐसे व करेगा ठीक है चलो पासवर्ड पर कैसे करेंगे पासवर्ड भी चेक करते हैं तो पासवर्ड कैसे चेक करेंगे अगर मैं पासवर्ड पर क्लिक पासवर्ड पर क्लिक करके अगर मैं यहां पर जाकर इंस्पेक्टर क्लिक कर दूं तो आप देख सकते हो यहां के कोण से पासवर्ड आ रहा है तो आप देख सकते हो पासवर्ड का है नेम पासवर्ड ठीक है तो मैं करूंगा अब के भाई तुम पूरे वेबसाइट रिकॉर्ड पर देखो जहां पर भी तो मैंने यह इक्वल टू पासवर्ड मिल जाए वहां पर चले जाओ ठीक है यह जो मैं सामने आई फिर उसके बाद में लॉग इन करना तो पहले लॉगिन बाद में देखेंगे पहले पर यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड कैसे डाल सकते हैं वह लेते हैं ठीक है तो देखो तो कि मैंने इंपोर्ट टाइम इसलिए कहा था क्योंकि मैं थोड़ा मिली सेकेंड्ली वेट करवाया जाता हूं इसलिए आप अच्छे से देखा तो मैं लिखा टाइम notes35 तो 500 यह इस वेबसाइट को लोड करने के बाद 5 मिलीसेकंड वेट करेगा जैसे आप चीजों को अच्छे से देख आओ अब मैंने कहा मान लो अब आपको क्या हाल है यह ने देखो अभी मैं यह यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड दोनों कलर डाल रहा हूं क्योंकि जैसे आपको लॉग इन करना तो आप यहां पर यूजर नेम अपना यूजर नेम डालना जिससे भी इस प्रोग्राम में अकाउंट से आप लॉग इन करना चाहते हो तो आप अपना पासवर्ड डालना है इस जगह पर ठीक है तो यूजर नेम पासवर्ड अभी मैं गलत डाल रहा हूं क्योंकि मैं जो सालों से खाना चाहता हूं ठीक है तो यूजर नेम पासवर्ड नाम है अपने 22 वेरिएबल बना लिया और उसमें मैंने अब यूजर नेम व पासवर्ड भूल गया ठीक है डाला है मैंने उसके बाद आप देख सकते हो कि आप हमने चीज देखी थी हमने यह चीज देखी थी कि के मेरे को इससे इंटरेस्ट करना है इससे तो मैं यहां पर जाकर अगर इंस्पेक्टर क्लिक करूंगा तो यह कूड़े नेम क्या यूजर नेम ठीक है तो मैं क्या कर सकता हूं मैं यहां पर लिखूंगा एक वीर्य में शुक्राणु क्या ड्राइवर में हमारी सारी फंक्शनैलिटी है तो मेरे घर ड्राइवर डॉट फाइंड एलिमेंट बाय नेम हम किससे बुला रहे हैं इसको हम बारे में नेम से आप देख सकते है हमने नेम था यूजर नेम हम नेम से कॉल कर रहे हैं तो हम लेंगे फाइंड एलिमेंट्स बाय नेम ठीक है और क्या नाम है आप देख सकते हो यूजर नेम नाम है ठीक है हम कह रहे हैं कि सारे एचटीएमएल के एलिमेंट सर्च करो नेम वाले ठीक है सारे पूरे कोण में एसडीएम एलिमेंट सर्च करने वाले वह जहां पर भी आपको नीम की वैल्यू यूजर नेम मिल जाए उस वाले बॉक्स से इन ट्रैक्स कराना चालू करो ठीक है तो वह चीज नया यूजर नेम इज टोटली तो सेम थिंग ड्राइवर नॉट फाइंड एलिमेंट बाय नेम पासवर्ड वह में पासवर्ड में टोटल है ठीक है कि अब चलो अब इससे क्या होगा यह एलिमेंट को प्वाइंट आउट करने लगेगा हम कहां तक पहुंच गए हम यहां तक पहुंच गए कि भाई यूजर नेम को प्रॉपर गया कि यहां पर पॉइंट कराना है पासवर्ड को प्रज्ञा यहां पर कोंट्रा मुक्त कराना है ठीक है यह तो मैं समझ में आ गई अब क्या करना है अब हम यहां पर वैल्यूज पोस्ट करनी है तो वैल्यूएशन कैसे सपोर्ट करेंगे हमने इसमें टोकरा या यूजर नेम मैं तो हम लेंगे यूजर नेम डॉट्स एंड की ठीक है सेंड की सेंड की स्क्रिप्ट क्या करता है कि उस टेक्स्ट बॉक्स पर वह चीज फाइट करता है ठीक है जो हमें बेल्ट करानी है तो यह चीज टाइप कर देगा तो जैसे मैं लिखूंगा मैं इस पर की यूजर नेम डॉट सेंड कीजिए और क्या वैल्यूज पास कर दो यूजर नेम जो मैंने यहां पर दिया है ठीक है यह वाले यूजर नेम यह चीज पास कर दो और पासवर्ड डॉट सेंड की इस बड़ी वाला पासवर्ड पास कर दोस्तों यह दोनों बॉक्स में यह दोनों चीजें पास कर देगा ठीक है अगर मैं इसको एकजुट करके आपको दिखा हूं तो हम देखते हैं कैसे बात कर रहा है यह देखो तो है तो फिर सिंपल है यह आंवला उसमें कुछ हाई-फाई फैंसी साइंस नहीं है आप बहुत आसानी से ऑटोमेट कर सकते हो तो मैं जरूर अंखिया सबसे कम है ड्राइवर खुला फिर गूगल क्रोम खुला इस पर लेकर आएगा दिस दिस इज कंट्रोल्ड बाय ऑटोमेटेड सॉफ्टवेयर सॉफ्टवेयर अपना इंस्टाग्राम खुल गया इस दौरान होने के बाद देखोगे तो देखो अब देखना अब आप देख सकते हो कि यूजर नेम मिल चुका है और पासवर्ड कर चुका है दोनों अपने-अपने लो चुके हैं ठीक है हमने कितना छोटा सा को कितना यूज है यूजर नेम और पासवर्ड डाल चुका है अब मैं छुट्टियां करना है लॉग इन बटन पर क्लिक करवाना है ठीक है तो यह हमारा लॉगिन हो जाएगा तो आपको उनका ऑटोमेट हो जाएगा कितना सीधी है अच्छा दूसरे कि जब मैं आपको ऑप्शन ज्यादा चाहता हूं कि जैसे आपने अभी ऐसे व किया मतलब मैं यह कैसे सिखाया कि आप ऐसे करके इंस्पेक्टर के नीम से आप देख रहे हो पूछ सकता है कि यह चीजें कभी फेल हो जाए ठीक है अवसर पर यह चारों ओर फैल हो जाए तो क्या चीज की कभी भी फैमिली होगी आप क्या कर सकते हो कि जो भी आपको डाइरैक्ट जरा यह बिल्कुल है तो आप इसको पर यह क्लिक करो आप यहां पर कॉपी पर जाओ कॉपी पर जाकर आप लिखोगे कॉपी एक्सपर्ट ठीक है कॉपी एक्सपर्ट पर क्लिक कर दोगे हैं और अगर मैं यहां पर देखो यूजर नेम पासवर्ड इसको मैं कमेंट कर देता हूं कि अगर मैं देखूं यहां पर अगर मैं लिखूंगी यूज़र नया एक रियल बना लूं मैं यूजर नेम इक्वल टू ड्राइवर डॉट फाइंड एलिमेंट बाय एक्सपर्ट मैंने कॉपी किया था इन डेवलपमेंट बाय एक्सपर्ट और अगर मैं इसमें मामलों पेट करा दो ठीक है इसमें मैंने वह चीज पेस्ट करा दी पासवर्ड भी बने रहते हैं मैंने केवल यूजर नेम एक्सपर्ट से करवा लिया तो यह चीज कभी फेल नहीं होती है ठीक है मैंने क्या किया पहले मैं नेम से करवा रहा था एक्सपेक्ट मदद से इन चीजों पर एक्सपर्ट से भी ला सकते हैं वह मैं आपको बता रहा हूं हमें यूजर नेम से देखा ही था तो यह एक्सपेक्ट क्या कभी विफल नहीं पता मुझे सेंड एलिमेंट वायरस कॉपी कैसे करते हुए आपको सिखा दिया और अब मैं इसको ओपन करूंगा तो सेमी फंक्शन आईटी व करेंगे यह भी वैसे ही टाइप कर देगा जैसे टाइम नहीं कर दिया यूजर नेम की जगह व्यक्ति के लिए यह साल का यह दूसरा वह करने का यह चीज का क्या कभी फेल नहीं हुई अभी जो एक्सप्रेस की वृद्धि होती है वह यूनिक होती है ठीक है हो सकता है कभी-कभार पॉइंट कलेक्ट हो जाए अगर आपने हमारा हाल तो ठीक है तो आप एक बात का भी यूज कर सकते हैं हम तो अब हम देख लेते हैं जो ओपन पैक हैं तो देखते हैं कि फील होता है कि नहीं हमने एक्सपर्ट से किया है है तो देखो तो अब आप देख सकते हो एक बात से फेल हो चुका है ठीक है तो एक्सपर्ट से फील हो चुका है तो कोई न कोई टेंशन वाली बात नहीं है एक्सपर्ट से भी कर सकते हैं हम चलो इतना आप हमें समझ में आ गया अब क्या करें अब हमें केवल रह गया है एक अपना लॉग इन बटन तो Login तरह करना क्लिक करवाना है ठीक है तो मैं यहां लिख देता हूं कि अ कि वैश्ष्ट टू कि वे टू को सिलेक्ट कि एलिमेंट ठीक है बिल्कुल की फाइल में को दे दूंगा हां है तो अपने करा दिया तो बहुत सिंपल मैं

शुरू कराया था तो जैसे ही अपना पासवर्ड यहां तक गल जाएगा ठीक है और पासवर्ड मॉडल जाएगा तो पासवर्ड पर अपने क्या कर रहा था कि आप अपने पासवर्ड सबसे पहले पोर्ट करा दिया था ठीक है यह वास्तव में को पता है कि वह अपने पास आउट कराया था इस लाइन तक अब मैं कहूं जब पार्ट हो गया तो उसके बाद अगेंस्ट एंड ही इज मतलब उस चीज पर अपन क्या कर रहे थे अपन यह क्या कर रहे थे वैली सपोर्ट कर रहे थे यहां से ठीक है अब मैंने क्या

Transcript:
okay great thank you thank you everybody go back for like go back a little bit okay okay uh yes shankar let's go live to live team here okay great thank you thank you everybody for joining in my name is chris i had campus hiring for my entry with me is uh ritu chakrabarty head of learning and development at mayandry and austin who is the head for orchard people function as well as other business units people function at my tree uh we are excited to speak with you today about the offering that we have called my entry edge program all of you have registered who have come in here i'm sure are excited and looking forward to listening to what this program is about and what's in it for you and that's the reason for the connect as well let me start off by probably sharing my screen and showing you some very exciting graph which you will i'm sure like to see let me know austin or ritu when you can see my screen is it visible okay superb so as you can see this is the share price of mind tree across the last one year and if i have to extend it to the last one year or five years you can see the phenomenal growth that mine tree is witnessing right there have been ups and downs across the last uh maybe till 2019 and then onwards you are actually seeing a phenomenal growth which is happening and this in one slide captures what mine tree is all about and where we are headed and the kind of future that you have with a company like mind tree so just to show you this graph probably you're seeing 2018 there was an increase which happened in the share price and then 2019 there was a plateau and then from 2020 onwards in spite of the pandemic being there the share price has been increasing and today it is probably two and a half times to three times the share prices that it was in 2019 and there's a reason for this i'm sure some of you may know those of you who have seen our logo have seen the change which is there we are now part of the larsen and two pro group and we were acquired in 2019 so my tree went through a phase of restructuring and making sure that we are poised for the future and you can see that's the reason that there was a bit of a plateau in 2019 while we went through those changes but whatever changes we have made have resulted in mind tree that you see before you today which is growing phenomenally i'm also happy to announce that yesterday our ceo actually sent across a communication saying that we have been rated amongst india's best companies to work for you may have heard of great places to work gptw so we are also ranked under gbtw which means from a company's growth perspective phenomenal growth that we are seeing from a culture perspective phenomenal culture which resulted in us getting a certification or a rating by great places to work it just does not happen like that for every company and you are poised to come in to a program which has a phenomenal future inside of mind right so with that introduction let me take you through a couple of slides about mind tree to familiarize some of you who may not be aware about uh the facts and figures that mine tree actually is at it probably takes maybe about a minute or so for me to run this by you so as you can see our revenue last year was 1.2 billion dollars and i'm not even going to convert that to indian rupees it's a lot of money we are of course one of the top 10 i.t services companies in the country today though we are young we are just 20 years old we are competing with companies which are twice our age if you have to look at it that way and 10 times our size and we are winning contracts against many of these large behemoth companies in the i.t space so if that is happening it is not because of the number of people which we have definitely there are companies which have five times 10 times the number of people so it's not for that reason it's not because of the buildings that we have i'm sure other companies have got 10 times the number of office spaces or the number of computers it's purely for the intellectual capital that mind tree has right small is big in this case and we're definitely winning as you can see we are spread across the world we are part of the larsen and dupro group which gives us added advantages and opens up new doors for us lnt as you would know is a a globally known name in the space of infrastructure you may not know it's also in some other spaces uh engineering defense as well do read up about last night to understand a little more uh quickly running through maybe this one last slide that i have before i hand over to ritu is for you to understand where all my tree is present what are the kinds of businesses that we are in and what are the kinds of work that we do we call this the four by four by four strategy at maintaining its four industry groups four service lines and four geographies of course there are some additions which are happening in or here for example if you look at the middle one we have customer success uh data and intelligence cloud and enterprise infrastructure and id we have divided our businesses to make sure that we are targeting all of the pain points and success areas that we can deliver for customers the deep expertise that we possess in these areas if you look at the kinds of domains that we are present in there is something that we call rcm retail consumer products and manufacturing i won't read out the full forms you can see it on the screen bfsi you probably know as banking financial services we call dths transportation travel and hospitality and cmt communication media technology we also recently added something called the health industry group as you can see it cuts across all of these different i mean it's a new vertical which is there we are of course present across the world and north america canada in the uk ireland if you look at continental europe as well and also the middle east and asia pacific new zealand australia we are present across all of these countries and continents so to summarize mind tree from a growth perspective is riding a phenomenal wave you are at the right place at the right time if you look at the kind of businesses that we are in the kind of services that we provide for our customers you couldn't look for a better company to start your career with and with that exciting note about mind tree and share prices and where we are headed and looking forward to you being part of the journey let me hand it over to ritu like i said ritu heads the learning and development for maintree the campus learning and development also comes under our portfolio and she is going to speak to you about the edge program with thanks thank you yeah so i'll start i i'm wearing a little bit eco let me just put myself on yeah yeah thank you so much chris i think as you rightly said mind tree is the happening place and uh there are so many things good things are happening at my tree um with that in mind i'll talk about the edge program definitely but another note to the all the participants who have joined us a very good evening to all of you and um so excited to talk to you in this platform um when we have initiated the registration and we on last friday and we got 34 000 registration out of which we had shortlisting exercise very robust one and you are one of them who had been shortlisted for interviews and uh test so i would start with an applause to you and would start with a pat on your back that yes from 34 thousands of registration you are one of them who have been shortlisted for interviews so having said that let me talk about a little bit on this particular program that we are for today this is called my tree edge program which gives you an opportunity to earn your m tech program while you are working with us so there are three four um phenomenal opportunities that you will get one is definitely the m-tech and that too from bits pilani it's a four-year journey that you will go with us and bits pilani for this ntec program but you will also get deployed in the project so you will get experience in the project live project client projects and the best thing is while you are earning your degree you are actually earning your ex uh having your job experience so um it's a it's a fantastic opportunity for you to earn and learn together as i said it's an m tech program week in class and it will be a semester system and you will have a lot of experience job experience in uh with my tree so we'll move on to the next slide um chris if we can move on to the next line yeah thank you so this is a the journey typical journey that we can think about yeah yeah yeah so uh if you clear your test and interview you will join us in august and then your journey with binary starts with a three months program which we call orchard as chris was mentioning that this is this archer program is to make you ready for project work so we cover foundation we cover uh specialization which is mentioned as track like say ai track or cloud track or java track so we have those specializations then we also uh give training on um how do you execute project and we call it as delivery and that that's how you will understand that what's a mindful way of working and of course there is a behavioral piece which says that how do you behave in a corporate environment so to make you ready for corporate citizenship so that's how it you start in august and then you start on the application perspective with bits pilani which takes a while and then october is when you start your bitspilani m-tech journey which goes on for four years and there will be weekend class for this particular intake degree while by november you will complete your archer journey and you will be ready for project allocation and start your work uh with the projects as i said live projects client projects you will get experience with so you continue from november onwards the experience as job experience and your education goes hand in hand and you will likely to complete uh your four-year degree program by october 20 000 to 2025. so with that i will hand it over to my colleague austin for further details thanks litha um thanks chris uh thanks for this uh uh wonderful opportunity to talk to the future mindful minds and um i would also like to congratulate as as ritu mentioned like to congratulate all the attendees who have gone through the strong evaluation process and from registration till now um now coming to the career uh what is it for you as a individual who wants to join this organization what is in it for you the first one is of course you're going to join us as an apprentice in the first year of your joining you will be a trainee or an apprentice with an organization and you will uh move ahead in your career in in the in the subsequent years right um once you are onboarded into mind tree um you will be as i said first year is your apprenticeship second year onwards is when you will become an employee of the organization you will be a full-time employee there will be certain benefits which an employee would get and then you will be eligible for that once the second year kicks in the first year you are still an apprentice um once what is in it for you after this four years once the graduation of yours is done from bits pilani after the four years graduation program you will be considered as a you will be considered for a refitment when i say refitment in terms of your role in terms of your work you're going to do which project all those things will be re-looked at during the after the four years of your completion um in the case of uh you are not able to clear or you're not able to continue with this program then there is a slight amount which will be recovered from you from from your side this is predominantly because the cost the organization is going to incur in terms of your compensation or in terms of the training we're going to go through you go through this is what we are trying to safeguard here um the 75 000 is is a recovered in case if you leave us in between this program um apart from your compensation the cost which the organization is going to take into consideration for the bits pilan which means to say that you are not paying anything it is already been uh contracted with the organization and the amount will be a 4.8 lakhs which the mine tree will directly pay to the uh or college i'm sorry uh directly paid to the college in terms of your course fee uh moving to the next slide uh chris okay this is how your compensation or your salary is going to be for the next four years after you join the organization uh you'll start your uh career or you're starting your compensation at fifteen thousand seven fifty which is mentioned there um okay let me let me highlight that would be uh okay uh yeah uh 15750 is what you're gonna get as your compensation or a monthly takeoff you will also be eligible for the monetary insurance program um i'm sure you have seen how the challenging times we had in the last two years uh starting from 2020 till now um what how important a health insurance is how important it is it is in the difficult times so you will be covered uh the organization has taken into uh has been mindful and has taken that into consideration that um anybody who's part of the organization needs to be given a health insurance and that insurance is what the mind tree is going to cover the and the total gross the total monthly gross for you as an individual is 16 300 in which 5000 sorry 550 rupees will be deducted for the insurance so this is the monthly for the year one once you complete your year one you will directly move to 21 100 as your compensation which is your monthly salary within which as as i mentioned in my previous slide year two you will be an ft which means that you are in a full-time employee you will be covered under the gratuity act uh so there is a graduated deduction and uh the total gross is two thousand six sixty five for the organization in which there is a deduction of graduate and there is a deduction of uh uh insurance and you will be having a twenty one thousand one hundred as your salary come year three uh you will the the compensation would remain the same and year four is where you will see another change where your compensation will move to twenty four thousand uh uh because there is an increase in your basic uh there is a contribution towards latitude will increase the insurance premium will remain 550 which which winery is going to take care of but your monthly gross from the year three to year four is now gone increasing from twenty two thousand six sixty five to twenty five thousand seven not four so the total compensation or the ctc which you are gonna have in the year four is three like eight thousand now um if you add it to the uh total cost or the total um what is that you gonna earn one of course this program is all about earn and learn program which means to say that you are going through your mtech program in uh from bitspilani the course phase is mentioned there um so if you add up all the three months sorry four years of uh course fee it translates to 4.8 which i uh showed that in the previous slide but the total cost to the organization in the last next four years is going to be 15 lakh uh 28 000 uh whereas for the fourth year when you're going to complete your graduation or your m tech program the compensation would be at four lakh twenty three thousand that is the total cost as a cost uh it is more more of what mine tree is paying to the mtech course plus your compensation which i'm paying you as salaries together this is the cost which the organization is going to take care of um also what you're gonna have after this after year two uh sorry after the year four once you complete your program of course you will be reconsidered or your your compensation will be relooked that your fitment will be looked at and based on the opportunities available at that point of time you will be given that opportunity so that is what we had in terms of the compensation perspective in terms of the learning perspective and also about the organization what who which you wanna currently which you are planning to join so this is a complete set of things which we wanted to give you as a a quick snapshot we are open for uh questions now um you can type your questions in the question and answer section on the top of of the team's application and we'll start answering your question uh with that thank you so much uh austin i'll just give you the questions that we have here sorry thank you uh like i was saying before we move into the questions let me uh please make a few announcements all of you that are here today we have shankar your screen is yeah can you okay thank you so few announcements here first all of you who are attending this campus connect session and

interviews will happen i'll move on to the questions here all right uh the first question that is also repeated is if selected will laptop be provided by you or do we need to carry our own laptops okay so let me take that for ya thanks so laptops are by policy provided to people who join our campus programs once they finish the learning program for the duration of the learning program whether it is for the edge hiring whether it is for the c1 hiring which is our software engineers or our technical support engineers everybody uses their own laptop for the learning period program perspective and post that you will be given the mind laptop when you get into production when you get allocated to the business and the laptops you can either come and pick it up for a minute office or we can have it shipped to you this is of course presuming that you attended the assessment cleared it cleared the interview process got an offer joined us went through the base program which is there and then allocated to projects thank you chris next question for you ritu this question is pretty simple uh if you can explain the online classes that will happen on weekends so the question is whether the uh classes are online or offline and uh how are they expected to attend it etc yeah so these are multiple questions that have combined into one yeah yeah so um the online uh of course the classes are online and these empty classes will be taken by bits pilani professors um and everything is virtual as of now um the platform and how to join and all these things have will be taken care by us and giving um good clarity of how do you do that all the instructions will be provided to you so nothing to worry about it all right the next question again uh ritu what are the domains that we will be working in at maintree for the first year very good question and um really glad that you have asked um so the domain which we are thinking about uh the industry domain uh i mean there are a lot of industries for whom we work right whether it is manufacturing industry or whether it is retail industry or banking industry um product industry so all these um definitely mind you can go to my website to see where all we are working and communication industry so all these industries definitely you get an opportunity anywhere based on the business demand you will be deployed and if the question is around what type of work a lot of times we have questions that whether it's a development work project work whether it's technology which technology area that i'll be working so it's purely driven by the business demand and of course there is no restriction in terms of uh where you can work so depending on the business situation you will be given opportunity to work anywhere in any type of projects any type of domain any type of technology and then that's completely based on your performance that you will do during the orchard training that is the first three months training that you will do we definitely do certain evaluations during that time and again as i said aligning it to the business demand we will give you the opportunities thank you um chris if you can please uh reiterate the eligibility criteria that we are following because i see a lot of questions around it and it a lot of people are not sure either okay austin can you do you mind taking that question because i'll take that sorry this is my videos yeah so yeah the eligibility criteria as we've advertised on the webpage where you registered as well as communication which has been sent out to you in terms of a job description uh you have to be 2020 or 2021 graduate only if you are either before that or if you are still studying and are going to graduate next year you are not eligible to sit for this process we are looking at only bsc and bca talent specifically that if you are from a bse background you should have had core mathematics as part of your program of your undergraduate program and this is critical because the program being provided by bits pilani which is the mtech program has a requirement by ugc that you have to have core mathematics right so without that you will not be able to transition from your bsc bse into an m tech degree that's one of the eligibility criteria in 10th and 12th if you have passed that's good enough in your undergraduate program you should have received a minimum of 60 percent which means that your marks across the undergraduate should aggregate up to 60 or 6 cgpa 59.5 5.9 all of this is not actually allowed as per the base requirements which has come from bits in addition to this if you look at what are some of the other aspects that we look at from an eligibility perspective a willingness of course to do the mtech program you should be willing to spend that four years of studying and learning it's not going to be an easy journey because you will be working monday to friday and on saturday and sunday you will be looking at doing the program so these are some of the eligibility criteria and uh if i've missed anything would you like to add are there any other aspects that we would look at from the lnd side no i think you have covered all sure thank you thank you chris um virginia here says that thank you for providing a good insight on the organization can we know what kind of projects and roles we can expect after the initial training i will pick that up yeah so as i mentioned that we have a lot of projects going on right and live client projects so and across various industry groups that we work whether it is communication media telecom or whether it is retail as i mentioned multiple industries groups that we have all these details are there in my tree website so um any kind of industries um or any kinds of project and the role which you are asking for so the role typically um it could be in the development project it could be in the testing project it could be in the maintenance project production support it could be anywhere as i mentioned it is purely based on the business demand and you will be given an opportunity to work and to start with certainly you are given a role to perform to understand the customer's requirement to understand uh what kind of technical performance that you have to do whether it is coding or whether it is testing or whether it is a support work or analysis of code or analysis of requirements so it could be anything it could be data it could be um a cloud that you're working with so it could be anywhere based on your capability during the that you will demonstrate during the three months learning journey in orchard and aligned to the business demand of the organization over to you priya thank you um um chris can you please highlight the assessment and the interview pattern it has already been shared on the main the entire timeline however if you can please uh explain the assessment that they are attending today sure so if you look at the assessment you have an aptitude section which has english logical and quantitative you also have a technical mcq question section which covers basic code which is given and you have to choose from the multiple options given based on what the question is i think it's fairly straightforward and should not be too complex from a level perspective it's at a medium level so it should be fairly easy for a good number of you and once sorry and once you finish the assessment process we will of course announce results later tonight itself and the interviews will happen tomorrow and if there is a requirement to do it on thursday as well so either wednesday or thursday is when we're planning to finish the interviews and basis that then the next steps information will be given thank you chris austin the next question is for you a lot of people have not understood the um fees that uh we are paying to the m for their mtech and they are worried that they have to pay for it if you can please explain that bit once again i think austin has some signal issue issues he's here yeah i'm there um thanks for that question uh priya um to explain to cross uh reference to what we had mentioned in the ppt the amount which the pittsburgh course which is about 4.8 lakhs will be paid by the mind tree to the institute directly it will not be uh there is no uh closet there is no requirement for the individuals or the candidates to pay any amount to the pittsburgh uh college uh it will be directly it is between the organization mind and the institute pittsbullani where the fees will be paid every year based on you guys clearing those uh every year uh journey i mean every year there are semesters it's gonna be an eight semester four years eight semester each after each semester uh whatever the course fee needs to be paid to the uh bits pilani college it will be paid by the organization directly to the college uh individuals need not have to pay anything neither to maintain not to the college i hope that answers the question uh yes austin thank you um this is not a question here however the sessions that we had in the past or the interviews that we have been taking last few days uh we faced a lot of issues where people did not understand core mathematics or what exactly uh it meant and that they have to have it so if you can please shed some light on what kind of subjects fall under it so that people are sure about the eligibility criteria as well okay um i think core mathematics when we say it is we are talking about that it is has to be part of the core curriculum a lot of times say business mathematics or applied mathematics these are not the subjects considered by bitspilani as a core mathematic so without having any kind of an application of mathematics as a subject you can have any name to that based on your curriculum but instead of those kind of subjects as i said the application of mathematics it could be business it could be applied mathematics those are not accepted whereas mathematics is a pure mathematics as a subject is uh what is considered by bitspinning and we have we have given this uh information on our website also so that there is no confusion yeah thank you uh this question again is a repeated question but people have a tough time understanding how they are eligible for m-tech when they are bsc and bca background students i will uh take that up for priya yeah yeah so this is a unique thing and um first first when you hear that you will think that okay how is it possible but this is a unique opportunity and this is um a unique program by bits pilani also which is called as work integrated learning program and this is uh this is for bse and bca graduates me i mean designed for that so the curriculum structure four year curriculum structure weekend classes are designed for the fitment of bac and bca graduates so nothing to be worried and not thinking that whether this will be a valid integ degree at the end if you have that kind of a question let me clearly tell you and that is why we are going with a name that matters right i mean and then we believe we trust that institute it's bitspilani and um this entire program is meant for bsc and bca graduates where you're given the opportunity to work well you will learn right i mean during the work also you will learn and when you are actually executing projects you are working as one of the team members in the project so that also will give you a lot of exposure and experience and definitely that the classes the formal education the weekend classes with bits pilani will give you the degree so overall um it is the entire journey is customized for bsc and bca graduates nothing to be worried about that and initial three months program of orchard will ensure that you understand how things happen in our projects and what kind of uh knowledge that you would need whether it is the as i mentioned previously whether it is the foundational part of it or whether it is specialized technology or the behavior part of it or way of uh doing it like the processes and quality and things like that so all these dimensions will be taken care to equip you uh for performing in the projects and those three months or shared program will give you those kind of knowledge and as i said its entire journey is customized for bse nbc thank you so much for the elaborate response on that there is a question uh follow as a follow-up to the same uh response that you just gave is what is the future for someone with a bsc bc a background and then an mtech with experience with mind tree for four years what should they expect from their future in their career these are yeah very nice question and uh again interesting question you should know you have the right to ask this kind of questions so that you are very clear about what you are getting into and what will be your career going forward so um let me start with the fact that yes four years you are excited to have the m tech degree beyond that as austin was mentioning that after one year itself you are absorbed to a mind tree as employee and you will continue so of course your mind trick area looks very bright from second year onwards your permanent employee and then you will be performing in the project so as others are performing you are at par and you have the opportunity to convert transform your career from where you are currently and uh getting into the it industry beyond four years again as i said um you are at par you are doing the same work as the others are doing in the projects as as per your experience level as per your capabilities so you have the opportunity to get other rules you can continue in the same role but you are already an employee in mind tree so you continue growing at mine tree as well as have a bright future so all in all i think it is definitely promising for you to start your career with a very good opportunity as a combination of work experience earning money as well as uh getting your degree done in four years and once you have the mtech degree obviously i don't have to say that you are well ahead in the career card right having an empty degree from bitspilani along with the work experience of four years so uh that's that's pretty much on this thank you so much austin i'll let you take the next question which is uh the if people can continue with mine tree if they decide to leave the mtech program and vice versa if they decide to not continue with mine tree can they continue with the mtech degree still okay if you are not continuing with your organization you cannot continue with mtech degree that means to say that this collaboration between mind tree and bits plan course is specifically for this organization and you will not be able to continue if you decide to part ways with mind tree so if you if you if the employment cease to exist um this course also will be ended and you will not be able to continue this course after you leave mine tree thank you austin okay um uh chris a lot of people have questions about their job locations and work from home questions so if you can please uh address that okay so if you look at mine tree we care about people first and safety of people is not the number one priority for us so at main tree all of us on this call who are speaking with you today have been working from home since last march and the reason for this is of course the pandemic which is currently there and there is a definite risk to to people so whenever mine tree decides that the risk has mitigated and it is okay to get people back in is when we will talk about that but yes as far as a base location for you is concerned that will be allocated up front once you finish the program it could also change over the years right but nonetheless whenever a location is given you don't need to report that immediately whenever mind re gives the green signal saying that it's okay now for mind remains to come back to office if at all or in a face manner or however that's going to plan out that's when you will be required to come in i hope that answers the question about location and from our own perspective the locations are tagged to the projects and the skills which the learning program is also tuned to so for example if there's a business in chennai which needs people in a particular skill a and there is a project in bangalore which needs people for a particular skill b as you go through this learning program at some point the orchard lnd team in conjunction with our talent management team will decide as to who gets allocated to which track and who gets allocated to its location ritu would you like to add anything more about location at this point or it's too early to speak about that's true chris i think you have covered uh very nicely and we'll stick to that and that is what it is uh mine tree locations and based on the business uh demand the location gets aligned so it's simple uh but as you progress then only this gets this i mean uncovered thank you chris thank you um we see more of these same questions uh there is one announcement please i have seen a lot of questions asking if you can take your assessment on your mobile phones please do not try to do that you will not be allowed to take the assessment on your mobile phones you'll have to take it on your laptop that and if you get selected post the assessment round you'll have to take the interview also on a video mode on your laptops so please do not use your phone and as announced earlier you will have to use your own laptops for the learning period program so uh learning program period so please make sure that your laptops are are functioning and uh are under the minimum required configuration this was already mentioned in the registrations for forms that you have filled the minimum configuration please make sure your laptops are compliant with it also anyone who is already undergoing a master's degree mca mba etc from another university please note you are not eligible like chris already announced multiple times only bca and bsc students who have core mathematics as a subject from 2020 and 20 to 91 batches are eligible anyone outside this these parameters are not eligible for this particular program uh the last announcement there is no coding round in the assessment as already announced uh the assessment that you are going to attend today at 4pm does not have any coding questions okay so more of the same questions uh here that i see um do you want to explain a little bit more about the learning program that they will have at uh with the kalinga team so that is a question that i've seen a lot that uh what all are uh planned for them in the kalinga learning program okay so it's a synonym of orchard i think uh people should not get confused uh kalinga and orchard we i mean we use interchangeably so it is the same program i think i was referring to as orchard it is uh three months program that you will go through um out of which you will go through programming skill and the computer fundamentals those are the the foundation foundation learning journey for you then you will go through certain behavioral programs which are ranging from say customer centricity customer focus to agility in the behavior or the growth mindset and the corporate citizenship so that's a behavioral part of it or the soft skill that we call then you will also go through uh the delivery how to do mind tree way of project delivery which means that you need to take care of certain processes you need to take care you need to understand certain say coding standards or certain checklists so you really need to understand how mine tree delivers projects every organization has their own way of doing it so that we call as delivery and and we will certainly have certain amount of agile learning there secure coding as part of that delivery learning um we also have in terms of the innovation we have the design thinking as one of the sessions and you learn that um how to be more creative in your work and it's a mindset that you will demonstrate it but how do how do you learn so we take care of that learning as well as [Music] you will have track specific learning and that is a longer duration learning and a little elaborate which say which will give you um based on as i said based on the business demands and your capability we will have the alignment in the tracks so tracks could vary from cloud java ai it could get into sap so any anywhere it could be these kind of specialization tracks so you will learn that for a longer time and you will have assessments for each of these components to understand how you are progressing because this assessments will help you only to understand that whether you are doing well or you have to put more effort to perform better so that's pretty much for three months journey where you will learn a lot that how to uh be how to how to um perform your role in the projects at minetree thank you so much chris we have one question for you uh if the mtech program that bits pilani is offering is a ugc recognized program and uh whether these people should also be from the similar background okay i didn't understand the question maybe but i will give my interpretation of it and if i hope that suffices so one of the criteria is also that you should have done your undergraduate program from a young ugc recognized university college right so maybe that's where the question has emerged from because they would have seen that in our eligibility criteria for some reason if it is not affiliated under ugc then the chances of the enrollment with bits pilani going through also would be lower right because they have mentioned this as one of the criteria so i hope that answers it you have to have studied your undergraduate program it should be a ugc recognized course and uh college should be under that and uh this also is going to be on the same line uh thank you chris the that was half the question the first part was if the bits pilani mtech program itself is an is a ugc recognized program yes they have got a grant under that cgc to conduct this otherwise how do you take a bsc bca graduate and then transform them into an m tech it will not be recognized otherwise so yeah the legitimacy of it is definitely there and that's the reason that we have also partnered with the bits bilani for this program sure thank you so much chris uh with that just for the um sorry priya just for the benefit of all um ugcc stands for university grants commission if people are not aware ugcc stands for university grants commission thank you thank you so much austin with that we uh have come to the end of today's session thank you so much ritu and austin for joining us and answering the numerous questions that you did thank you so much chris for being with us and answering all the questions at youtube and uh we wish all of you guys very good luck for today's assessment rounds like announced earlier the uh people who clear today's assessment rounds will receive their interview schedules later today itself so please make sure that you check your inbox and be very alert when there is an email from minetree or our assessment partners which is vcp so please make sure that you check your emails and you are on top of it and attend the interview on time so please do not miss out on it we will not be able to reschedule it multiple times and the assessment will also not be rescheduled again if you miss out so good luck for that and uh thank you so much everyone and have a great day and we will see you wish you all the soon everyone yeah i'm going to study one wish you all the best everybody thanks ripple austin and see you next time thank you thank you for watching this live stream let's continue again with another video thank you very much guys bye bye subscribe thank you very much

मैं वीडियो स्टार्ट होने से पहले आता हूं वीडियो लंबा होगा ध्यान से देखिए बाद में मेल क्यों नहीं आया एकदम का यह मत पूछना और एक बात बताना चाहता हूं वीडियो के डिस्क्रिप्शन में टेलीग्राम ग्रुप के लिए है वह चेक आउट कर लो वहां पर ज्वाइन हो जाओ पहले यहां पर जॉन होने से क्या होता है प्रॉपर हम कम्यूनिकेशन कर सकते हैं और ऑल इंडिया के जितने भी बीसीए बीएससी स्टूडेंट से बेटे को रेस्टोरेंट से जो भी प्रिपरेशन कर

Transcript:
hi hello everyone welcome back to online study for you a complete placement solution so guys we have some openings to be discussed in this video so watch this video to the full to know about it and make your application by picking up the links from the description okay so first i'm starting with iq yeah if my pronunciation is right so here they are hiring for the software engineer trainee so it's completely for the freshers so here you can see the responsibility you can just go through that if you are willing with all these kind of things then you can just skip to the requirements that they are putting forward and you can register if that is okay with you okay so here uh they have provided like accountable to perform detail and application management with an ability to work in a fast pace in job like you must be uh should not be procrastinator you must do it everything well then good understanding of rgb based concept sql knowledge and proficiency one programming language like like java.net ability to come up quickly with a programming logic for a given requirement mandatory and shift paces then flexible to learn new technologies and move away so guys into this context one thing that i have to make a reminder is when you get into any of the id sector this is very important okay that does uh you must be able to learn new technologies and move on but okay flexible to learn because every time as the industry is getting updated we are a constant learner and a learner in this sector okay so that's it and uh support of good verbal and written communication skills is maturity flexible enough to adjust to changing work or technology and soft skills will be very good communication skills and faster learner good analytical and problem solving skills okay so these are the specification so they have not mentioned like this is only for this kind of uh graduation criteria only for that kind of graduation correctly yeah but it will be better if the pure science students could go for that because it's particularly for them because uh all the roles and responsibilities and the requirements that they have put forward is for them okay so uh they will be able to manage it quite well learning those kind of technology and if others who have a good uh knowledge in this technology or come something related to the computer sides you can go for that as well okay there is no hindrance in that and coming to the batch criteria obviously it is applicable for 20 21st batch and friends when you just uh before you know uh 2019 students 18 students 17 students when you just come up for any kind of questions like can we apply for this can you apply for that you know most of the job openings which is currently available right now to the time is particularly four to twenty and twenty first pass out okay nineteen eighteen seventeen those bad students are a kind of outback students you know that the gap education gap how important is it this uh united sector so you have the opportunities as well like 1980 some of the openings are for you as well so at that time you can even try applying for that okay but most probably um more opportunities like 2020 first and twenty past students are getting for this academic year will not be available for you so uh as you get soon you get some opportunity just grab it at the earliest and just build that academic draft okay so you know everyone is an employee as a great there are someone look for a single position there are hundreds of people standing okay so if you have a back uh you know gap or backlogged criteria then no one will ever get and unless you are talented unless you are scared if you are most one among the average students then uh you need to develop something to get into that position okay so that's it so yes to make it to this you have to make a login so let me log in first so this is the form that you have to fill you have to give your personal details to your address or these kind of information and then you can save and continue for the next which is for the my experience so if you have any prior experience you can give that and if you're refresher you can provide it like that and application questions will be there regarding are you ready to relocate all this kind of things that you can give and voluntary disclosure then after review okay so these are uh some sort of things that you should take care of while you apply for this okay so this is about uh the steps that you have to take care in this and coming to the ctc for this particular position they used to pay like uh 4.5 4.4 plus fpa for the freshers itself okay and pressures coming to that uh this may differ because someone will be taking internship and coming here and someone will be coming soon after graduation so it do depends so accordingly you will begin me okay so this is uh this ctc coverage that is available so it's a good opportunity for whoever looking for the core jobs in id sector i mean software uh related department so you can even try applying for that okay so this is about this and now moving on to the other which is an often opening which is coming at an accenture for a long time that is it helped us so it helped us across so much locations in india for the accent job there is a lot many requirements required so if you wish to get into these companies then you can uh make it at the earliest so here coming here it is uh the location is hyderabad and any graduates is fine from zero to one years of experience is what they're looking forward for and you know uh yes rules and responsibility you can have a look at this you are required to solve routine problems largely through precedent and referral to general guidelines and all these you can just go through and qualifications any qualification that they would require you to have all these so years of experience zero to one years so basically 2019 plus students can give it a try okay 19 20 and 21st can apply it here so they have not mentioned any kind of criteria like uh you must be this location and all this is applicable for the location hydra but but currently you'll be working from home enrollment okay so this is about the accenture and coming to the ctc too they used to for the thresholds itself they used to give like three point uh three three point five plus lpas available and if you have uh some sort of experience like zero to one years of experience is provided so if you have five six or one years of experience your ctc may differ okay this is the starting rate of ctc for zero years of experienced persons okay so if this is applicable for you can just try applying in in the company page itself you can just go with this apply now link and get filled with your form coming to registration steps you have to accept the terms and conditions then give your resume your basic details then advanced details everything and then after soon after that submit it okay so this is the basic steps that you have to take care of so i think all three just regarding this opening is pretty much clear to you and when coming to the uh you know next uh from the next month onwards every companies are coming for their next campus drive like online assessment those kind of uh structural selection process so it will be good if you could prepare at the earliest so to this we can help you with that coding and classes and here we have the aptitude classes which is about to start from first of august and daily classes are available from 8 to 9 and it's a 20 days crash course session approximately one month it's live and you'll be getting 400 plus aptitude plus reasoning questions and 10 years previously from 10 years uh question papers prepared from tcs so you can you know if you go through all these materials you can make sure that you win the tc's examination for 2020 second batch which is about to come and the nqt sessions which is available for everyone okay and whole of this package is available to you at just rupees 199 so you can just imagine to this package you are getting so much materials which is uh very much worthy and which will definitely help you okay so this is about uh the uh aptitude session which is happening which is a part one of the online assessment available and you know online assessment test is not about uh the aptitude session alone there's a coding part too in that if you're getting into id companies so in that it is very required to have the hands of pouring knowledge so to that also we can help you with that so my mom will be guiding you for that and from tc's previous 10 years question paper discussion will be there 300 plus mcq and coding questions will be available under this package from august 1 similarly the classes are going to start for 20 days crash course basics to advance is available access to whole of the class recordings is available and uh whole of this package is available to you address rupees 199 okay so six to seven is the time for coding and seven to eight is the time for uh attitude okay so this is about uh the courses that we offer so if you wish to get the guidance or if you wish to prepare well for your examination and attempt crack it to your dream company you may take it this and we are there to support you okay so everyone start preparing in one or the other way and apply and get um into company soon after your graduation okay so this is about all right and now coming on to the openings which is available so here uh to this today third we have uh from intra that is copy of associate marketplace and only channel here you can see the rules and responsibilities that you will be handling managing operational metrics for sellers the list productivity customer complaints etc

analyzing stored past performance and suggesting improvement plan design smart systems using excel etc role will be involving traveling to these stores for performing monitoring design qualities include basic operations understanding good thoughts process and problem solving attitude data analytics sql python will be plus plus okay so this is it so they have not mentioned like you must have uh this experience criteria or that if you are good at performing all these kind of rules and responsibility then you can apply for to this position okay so this is about it and coming to the application process this is the application form it's very simple you can just give all these things and give your resume cover letter if you have any then linkedin profile the website after that submit your application okay so this is about the openings available under this so if you wish to get into this uh position then you can definitely try so uh coming to the ctc detail available for this position you may get approximately of 3.84 plus lps for this position okay so we do differ here also they have not mentioned about only fractures or already experienced criteria they want you to perform all these kind of activities or take up the roles of responsibility so according to the knowledge you are having an according to experience we are getting having you will be getting varies of citizen okay if a person is fresher and if a person is having experience standing together for this position even if two of them got the job then the ctc available for this person will not be the same for the other two it will differ so something like that difference you can uh expect here too so this is the average package which is available and everything fall apart across simply okay so this is about the openings which is available and uh once again reminded the courses that we offer for the aptitude coding and everything which is the complete package on online assessment test okay so if you wish to go for that you can go with the link which i've mentioned in the description box you can register yourself for these courses in the description uh by taking the links from the description okay

=== TCS NQT Most Important Aptitude Topic | Statistics : Mean, Mode and Median | batch 2020,2021,2022 ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=5dkSA9R-i88

Transcript:
hello everyone and I welcome all of you to online study for you a complete placement solution friends in our today's video we are going to solve problem from statistics as you know statistics has become one of the very important topic in TCS examination so we need to practice few questions before you go and write the examination okay so this kind of questions were asked in the examination so before we move ahead with this problem we need to understand what all question can come from median and if you like the video then I will also make the same video I mean similar kind of video on mean and mode as well okay so in this video we will be discussing only medians so what is median so the medal number found by ordering all data points and picking out the one in the middle or if there are two middle numbers taking the mean of those two numbers is nothing but median okay so friends anyway they have told but before you calculate median anywhere we need to arrange them in ascending order and that's how you will be able to calculate the median now let us take one example so if I ask you to calculate median of this particular number okay so if we have only one middle number that will become your median so here your median will become here your median will become four okay remember we need to arrange first in ascending order so this example was already arranged in ascending order okay now so 2 3 4 5 6 7 if you have two middle number right so now we have two middle number in that case what we do so in that case we add both of them and right so basically we calculate mean of that so we add both of them and divide by two so it will be become 4.5 so this is what your simple median is okay now when the class and frequency will be given so that time calculating median will be different so we will have different formula you do not have to worry at all okay see the only thing what I want from you guys is so if you really understand uh the concept what I'm teaching you then what you have to just do is like and share with your friends so that everybody gets benefited without paying any single amount now question number one the score of seven students are so seven students are there their score is this the median score is so friends first we need to arrange in the sending order so 1 2 3 4 so 1 2 3 4 One More four is there okay and then we have six and eight so we have arranged them in ascending order How many middle number we have only one so that will become your median that's all question number two find the median of this okay now so before we find the median first we need to arrange them in ascending order 231 okay then 253 I'm sorry so this is a mistake from the marker okay so it is 2 31 and then 253 and then 255 then 2536 so friends very carefully you have to do in exam so that you do not do any mistake okay otherwise you'll be getting the wrong median now so how many middle numbers we have so we have only one middle number that will become your median so median for this particular question will become 256 okay clear question number three so what is the difference between mean and median of the set okay so mean is nothing but average this already you are aware right so mean will be nothing but average even I have also taught you in the topic average okay now so mean will be nothing but average will be nothing but sum divided by number so let us first add so 2 + 4 okay is 6 6 + 6 is 12 12 + 7 is 19 19 + 7 will be 26 26 + 13 will be 39 39 + 18 will be 57 okay 57 + 92 so 57 + 92 okay so divided by the total number is nothing but 3 3 6 28 so 57 + 92 by 8 so it will be 729 and 954 by 8 okay now friends so even in TCS if you want you can use the calculator so on a screen calculator will be there okay I could have divided it here but I'm also showing you how you can use the calculator in the examination so it is nothing but 18.625 so basically it will be on the left side okay so on screen calculator will be there you will be able to use it now if I will talk about the median then I have you know total eight that means two middle number so I have two middle number so my median will become equal to what so my median will become 7 + 7 / 2 that means 14 by 2 will be equal to 7 so 18.625 - 7 that means 11.625 will become my answer okay so 11.625 so option three um for the question number three is the answer okay now friends the actual question comes here so a survey regarding the weight of 45 employees of TCS was conducted and the following data was obtained find out the median weight okay now so friends before we find out the weight okay so there is some procedures okay uh which we need to understand and then only we will be able to do it so I will write down the formula here so median will be equal to l + n by 2 minus CF and divided by F into H okay so this is a formula for median okay now so what are the these terms are there understand carefully okay so now first I'm going to calculate the cumulative frequency okay cumulative frequency so the CF is nothing but cumulative frequency okay fine and everything I will tell you so do not have to worry at all so friends weight in kg is there and number of student is there so in the simple example I will tell you so there are you know 20 in between 20 to 25 kg weight there are total two students are there okay so weight in kg and here instead of weight student you can say employee so there are only two employees are there whose weight are in between 20 and 25 there are five employees are there whose weight are 25 to 30 there are eight employees are there whose weight are 30 to 35 there are 10 employees are there whose weight are 35 to 40 there are seven employees are there whose weight are in between 40 to 45 10 employees 45 to 50 and three employees 50 to 55 okay fine now so cumulative frequency we will calculate so how we will calculate cumulative frequency so two next time we will add both so 2 + 5 7 next time we will add this three so 7 + 8 15 or what you can do you can add 7 + 8 15 then what you can do 15 + 10 25 then 25 + 7 will be 32 then 32 + 10 will be 42 and 42 + 3 will be 45 so this is what we have got is cumulative frequency okay and so CF means nothing but cumulative frequ frequency okay and what is this n so n is nothing but the frequency has been given so let us add so 2 + 5 so you'll be getting nothing but 45 but I will add it for you so 2 + 5 is 7 7 + 8 is 15 25 32 42 + 3 so 45 so here n is nothing but equal to 45 okay you can also say n is nothing but the frequency okay now so number of employees total number of employees is nothing but 45 okay so the first thing what we do here we calculate n by 2 so once we calculate n by two we will be able to get the median class so 22.5 okay so the number just bigger than that so just bigger than that okay so just bigger than that so just bigger than 22.5 will be what nothing but 25 so in the cumulative frequency you see so just bigger than 22.5 will be nothing but 25 see even 32 is also bigger 42 is also bigger 45 is also bigger right but just bigger so that means this particular column so this particular column will be called as now median class okay so it will be called as now median class okay so first thing what we have to do we need to calculate the cumulative frequency once we get the cumulative frequency then we will be calculating n by2 so n by2 we have already got it okay now now we have few things to calculate what is l so L will be nothing but lower limit okay so L will be nothing but lower limit so l so L will be what so in the median class you see l so what is the lower limit so lower limit of the median class is nothing but 35 so see getting the median class is important once you get the median class then we will be able to get the other data now so median class got and then lower limit we have already got it then frequency f is nothing but frequency so in median class okay so in median class what is frequency so frequency is nothing but 10 so in the median class if you'll see the frequency so frequency is nothing but 10 okay so we got n by2 we got F we got L and what what is the H so H is nothing but class height okay so class height you can say so you can see 20 to 25 this is 5 difference five difference five difference so this will be nothing but five class difference will be nothing but five the difference has to be same you cannot say Sir here it is 20 to 25 then 25 to 35 no that will not happen Okay so the class height is five now the next is CF cumulative frequency how to calculate so friends uh what you have got 25 here right so n by2 is nothing but 22.5 and just bigger than that is 25 so just one previous to that so previous to that is 15 okay previous to that is 15 so CF is nothing but cumulative frequency okay just before the median class just before the just before the median class that's how you have got all the data now L what is l so L is 35 Plus n by 2 so n by 2 we have got is 22.5 CF is nothing but 15 f f is nothing but 10 and H is nothing but five so this is two times okay then 35 Plus so if you'll subtract then it will be nothing but 5 and 7.5 divided by 2 so 35 + so 75 if you'll try to divide it by two then 37 will be 74.5 so here it will become 3.75 so 38.757195 will be nothing but the median weight for this particular question okay so friends like this questions are coming in TCS from statistic topic and there are lot of questions which are coming from statistics so do not think this is very uh tough okay so I will tell you so if you understood this then erase everything right so cumulative frequency just write down here only 27 15 25 32 42 45 right so this and N by two so n so this total will be nothing but 45 okay so 45 by 2 will be 22.5 okay now l so this is your median class so L will be nothing but 35 Plus n by 2 22.5 minus uh CF so CF will be 50 divided by frequency 10 and class height five so once you are able to do that so your answer more than 35 so here 7.5 divid by 2 so 35 uh 3.75 Okay so 38.757195 it is not actually in exam you'll be able to do it so these kind of questions only we are going to practice so if you like the video then definitely do comment and Friends uh TCS coding previous year previous 10 years McQ and coding question live crash course has been started price is just $199 only for the first 50 student after that it will become 249 rupees okay now and similarly TCS aptitude and reasoning previous 10 years questions live crash course has been also started the link will be given in the description basically this course is going to start from 1st of August so many of you were asking and you can see there are many students who have already bought this so once 50 students will be there then the price will increase so if you want to go through the 10 years of the questions before your exam in such a low price such a uh small price then you will be uh able to get that so the link will be given in description join it today and if you have any doubt please do comment and if you like the video please do comment so that I will be continuing with mean and the uh mode and complete statistics different different problem thank you

=== TCS NQT May 2021 Asked Question | Aptitude &amp; Reasoning Question asked in may 2021 ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=wUdgR91776A

Transcript:
hello everyone and i welcome all of you to all and study for you a complete placement solution friends this is pratik srivastava here and in our today's video i am going to discuss tcs nqt may 2021 aptitude questions okay so friends what you are going to learn in this video so shortcut to solve the problem quickly because in the examination speed and accuracy plays a very important role okay and you will be seeing tcs nqt may 2021 question that means this year in the month of may whatever questions were asked so that questions i will be discussing with you and what are the topics covered so friends basically i have taken question from statistics which is a very important topic and then time and work data sufficiency time and distance compound interest and one question from simplification so from six topics i have taken one one question so question number one two three four five and six okay so please watch the video till the end because you are going to learn a lot of new things which you are definitely not aware okay now so question number one if m and m are the mean and median respectively of the numbers what is the correct relation between m and m now this question you need to solve with in 30 seconds okay see basically the time limit which you will be getting is around 1.4 minute okay or one minute but you can easily solve in 30 seconds but first let me solve in two to three minutes because i need to explain you here and once you understand the concept the sort tricks then you will be able to solve in 30 seconds so the question is 2 6 10 okay 14 18 22 26 and 30 these are the number for which we need to calculate mean and median and then you have to tell if they are equal or not so what will be mean so you know mean is nothing but average mean is nothing but average okay now so friends you can see the difference between the numbers are same the difference between the numbers are same so if the difference between number are same if the difference between the numbers are same then your mean or average will become first number plus last number divided by 2 that means 2 plus 30 divided by 2 so 32 by 2 will be equal to 16 okay so if the difference between the number is same or you can say if there is a common difference or you can also say if the numbers are in arithmetic progression is all these tricks i would have taught you if you have attended my classes in average so if the difference between the numbers are same if there is a common difference or if the numbers are in arithmetic progression then my mean will be first number plus last number divided by 2 so mean is nothing but 16 now let us calculate median okay now so friends before you calculate median you need to arrange the numbers in ascending order birthday crumb ascending order but here we can see the numbers are already in increasing order right already in ascending order so do not have to arrange okay now so what is the number how many number of terms are there 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 i have total 8 numbers are there so how many middle numbers i have so i have two middle numbers right see if if it will be seven if the numbers will be seven then i will have only one middle number but if i have the even number of numbers right that means i have now eight numbers here then i have two middle numbers two middle numbers means what i have to do the both middle number i have to add and then i have to divide by two so it will be 32 by 2 that is nothing but 16 so we say mean is equals to median that means the option d will be the correct answer trust me this question is very very easy but knowing this concept was very very important statistics is one of the very important topic okay so the link for the basic class will be given in description friends always please check out the description because many of the link i will give in description which you might miss it okay now so sir you said that you will solve in 30 seconds can you tell me how ah i will tell you do not worry see these are the numbers i have you can see the time okay now m and m are mean and median so as i can see the difference between the numbers are same that means my mean will become the first number plus last number that means 30 30 plus 232 by 2 will become 16 mean is this what about median so how many numbers are there eight numbers are there then the middle numbers divided by 2 so 14 plus 18 32 by 2 that is 16 by a mean and median is equal okay mean and median is equal see for having this you know solving this in 30 seconds what you need to know is the concept if you are lagging with concept then two minutes is also not sufficient for you and then you will come out and say sir the question is having a fixed timing it is not only for you it is for everyone whoever is writing the test for everyone okay now the question number two belongs to time and work again let me take some time to explain you and then i will show you you could have also solved it if within 30 seconds or maximum 40 50 seconds not more than that so ram can complete 50 percent of the work in four days by a 50 so ram is able to complete 50 of the work in four days so if ram wants to complete 100 work then ram will take eight days that's all see fifty percent work four days then hundred percent work you will be ram will be doing in eight days clear okay ram clear then haris so haris can complete then haris can complete one third of the work in four days so one third of the work in four days then 100 percent work that means one work haris will be able to do 4 into 3 that means nothing but 12 days see this is unitary method but now you are not a kid so that i should tell you all those things but anyway one by three work in four days so one work so four into three by one it will get interchanged so four into three will be 12 so okay now step three so chirag can complete one six of the working so chirag is able to complete one sixth of the work in how many days four days so chirag will be able to complete one working how many days four into six that means 24 days chirag will be able to complete one by six part of the work friends however see basic method will be very very simple so that you can use it okay now so i know ram can do in eight days haris can do it in uh 12 days and chirag can do it in 24 days so when they will be able to complete the work so take lcm okay so time and work using the lcm method i have taught you so you can refer that so once you take lcm it will become your work eight threes are twelve twos are 24 that means ram haris and chirag can complete six work in a day can complete six work in a day so total work is 24 so total work they will be taking four days hundred percent of the work they will do in four days but they are asking by a fifty percent of the work they will do in how many days so fifty percent of the work they will be doing in two days so this is a complete process to solve this so this is lcm technique lcm method to solve your time and work problem so two things unitary method plus this was involved okay now so what you have to do is you have to be good at unitary method okay and then you see how easily you will be able to solve so ram will be able to complete so you note down the time so ram will be able to complete 50 percent of the work in four days then total work ram will complete in eight is haris one third in four days so three into eight will be three into four will be twelve so haris will be able to do in 12 days chirag one sixth in four days so six into four will be 24 right now if we take the lcm so 24 now 24 divided by eight threes are twelve twos are twenty four one zero by six so four it is hundred percent worth two days they will be able to complete fifty percent of the work so we have used lcm method okay and friends one more thing in my lcm method i have told it's not necessary to take always lcm you'll say sir how fast you are taking the lcm how we will be able to take so it's not necessary to take lcm you think about a number you think about a number which is divisible by 8 12 and 24 for definitely friends for this you need to learn the basics of time and work which i have taught okay so 24 is a number which will be divisible by all three take that somebody said i i want to take 48 you take my nobody will stop you and you will be also getting the same answer so 48 also you can take 48 will be divisible by 8 12 and 24 okay now question number three so question number three is a very good question but i will tell you one formula using that formula you will be able to do it very fast okay now so rama traveled so first let me uh write the formula and then explain you the things then i will be directly solving the question in that particular second okay so the formula will be distance is s1 s2 divided by s 1 minus s 2 into delta of t so this is the formula we have to use for this kind of question which type of question we will understand so rama traveled at 7 kilometer per hour and missed a train by seven minutes that means suppose rama from her home okay she traveled with a speed of seven kilometer per hour but she missed the train by seven minutes that means she is reaching seven minutes late so suppose she had to reach by 9 a.m sir why you were taking me 9 am but yeah you take 12 am 15 and whatever you want you take man that doesn't matter okay so just i wanted to tell you here so rama was 7 minutes late however however if she traveled okay so however if she traveled at seven kilometer per uh 10 km per hour she would have reached the station five minutes before that means he would have reached at 8 55 am only so suppose he has to reach at uh 9 a.m so in this case he will bridging 5 minutes are limits 8 55 a.m so what is the time gap here you can see so the time gap here is nothing but 5 minutes here and seven minutes here 12 minutes is the time gap okay so 12 minute is the time gap 855 plus five will be nine and then seven minute more so five plus seven total 12 minute is the time gap now so s1 into s2 so my speed is 7 into 10 divided by 10 minus 7 sir i should take s1 minus h2 or s2 minus s1 see you take s1 minus h2 or s2 minus s1 no problem if you are getting negative just make it positive because distance will never be minus i traveled minus 10 kilometer no way that will not happen see if you are going in wrong direction also you are covering some distance so minus 10 kilometer minus 10 hours so time speed and distance will never be into your minus okay into delta t so it is 12 minute okay 12 minute but you see this is in kilometer per hour this is also in kilometer per hour so this time difference also we need to convert into hour how will you convert so 1 hour is equals to 60 minute okay so or you can write like this because you wanted to convert minute into hour so 60 minute will be one hour so one minute will be 1 by 60 hours so 12 minute will be equal to 12 by 60 hours okay so 12 divided by 60 this will get converted into hour that's all so 12 5's are and this will be 70 divided by three by five okay so fourteen five zero will be seventy fourteen by three so three four javi so use that option now do not start fourteen divided by three so three four zero will be 12 2 oh then 3 6 0 will be 18 so you are wasting the time where it is not required right okay so you can directly do it okay so there are actually two options starting with four so see three four there will be 12 360 so stop it here itself 4.67 kilometer okay so do not sit and around say you start doing it okay so you know right so i'm sorry there is two option so you can directly see it three four two so instead of doing this you try like this three four jaw will be twelve so two will come down three six uh okay that's all three point four point six seven kilometer will be the correct answer okay see there might be only one option we're starting with four so all those things you need to look in the examination okay so this habit you need to leave it this habit you need to live it okay because till then you are not leaving this habits then nothing is going to happen quick okay because you need the speed now so rama traveled okay so i i read the question and understood so seven minutes late or five minutes early so s one is two this formula also writing is not required okay so 7 into 10 divided by 10 minus 7 into 12 minute okay difference seven and five total twelve minute okay seven plus five will be twelve minutes okay convert it to one zero one zero cancel six twos are so fourteen by three fourteen by three three four zero twelve six three six or eighteen so four point six seven kilometer option c will be the correct answer see before your exam you should have practiced all this kind of question right and practicing the previous question will always help you because that kind of questions you are going to encounter in the exam now friends question number four so question number four is a question from compound interest and this is one of the best question what has been asked in the tcs nqt may 2020 examination sohan took a loan of 10 000 rupees at 20 per nm compound interest compounded annually at the end of each year he pays back 5000 rupees how much should he pay at the end of third year to clear all his dues so 10 000 rupees he is taking loan and his rate of interest is nothing but twenty percent okay now so friends one thing which you have to keep in mind compound interest will be always calculated on amount okay now so let us see amo and amount you know right so amount will be principal plus interest both so when principal and interest gets added that is nothing but your amount so first year 20 interest you have to give so 20 friends if you calculate then 20 by 100 it will be nothing but two thousand but do not calculate like this okay see twenty percent means right twenty percent here okay so this percentage will take two zero off so twenty into hundred will be two thousand rupees so first year you need to give interest as 2000 okay so at the end of one year 10 000 rupees is your principal and 2 000 rupees now became your interest and how much you are paying you are paying only 5 000 pc 10 thousand rupees loan you have taken and after one year you also need to give two thousand rupees interest but you are only paying five thousand rupees so how much still money will be remaining so 12 minus five seven thousand rupees still will be remaining now next year what will happen again twenty percent interest you have to give one seven thousand rupees so this percentage will take two zero off so seven into two will be one four double zero that means you have principle seven thousand rupees now and fourteen rupees again became interest okay now again you paid 5 000 rupees out of that so it became 2 000 and plus 1 400. so 3 400. now again 3400 rupees he have and third year also twenty percent interest you have to give this percentage will take two zero off so six eighty rupees interest that means three thousand four hundred rupees is your principle and now 680 rupees the interest for that principle so total 40 80 rupees now you have to give and so that your all dues will be clear so at the end of the year how much money someone has to pay sir 40 80 rupees so that he will be 4080 rupees so that he will be able to clear all his dues okay so this is one compound interest problem and again i will say this is not tough okay i will tell you how so this is the process you might have understood now so you can see so he has taken ten thousand at twenty percent so the first year twenty twenty percent of ten thousand will be two thousand so first year twelve thousand rupees out of that five thousand rupees he is giving so seven thousand rupees still he is there then again twenty percent so twenty percent of this will be what one four double zero seven into two will be fourteen so now second year eight thousand four hundred he is again giving five thousand rupees so it will become three thousand four hundred now again 20 okay now again 20 in the third year so it will be 680 that means if he gives 3400 and plus 680 rupees so if you give 4080 rupees then all his dues will be clear and he will be free from the loan amount so option four uh sorry option b for the fourth question is the correct answer now friends question number five so it's a easy problem so it's a simplification problem so the price of six pencil plus seven erasers so you have to make two linear equation and then solve okay is equals to twelve rupees and the price of two pencil plus fourteen eraser will be equal to eighteen rupees so this you multiply by twelve because i want to solve this linear equation so 6 into 2 will be 12 pencil plus 14 eraser will be equal to 24 rupees and 2 pencil plus 14 eraser will be equal to 18 rupees now so just subtract it so this will get cancelled 10 p will be equal to 6 okay so 1 pencil cost will be 6 by 10 that is nothing but 3 by 5 rupees okay now so put the pencil price in the first equation so six into three by five plus seven eraser will be equal to twelve okay now so seven is there will be equal to twelve minus eighteen by five so seven eraser will be equal to 60 minus 18 i have just taken the lcm divided by 5 so 7 eraser will be equal to 42 by 5 so 7 6 ja that means one eraser cost will be 6 by 5 rupees and one pencil cost is three by five now we have to find out five pencil plus five eraser cost so five into three by five plus five into six by five five five cancel 5 5 cancel 6 plus 3 will be 9 so 9 rupees that means option d will become the correct answer for your question number 5 okay so i hope this will be clear now question number 6 is a data sufficiency problem so given below is a question followed by three statement one two and three each containing some information decide which of the given statement is correct okay now so x is greater than y by eight so x will be equal to y plus eight okay so x is greater than y by eight okay now thirty percent of y so thirty percent of y is equals to twenty percent of x right okay so 30 by 100 into y is equals to 20 by 100 into x so hundred and hundred cancel one zero one zero cancel so three y is equals to two x okay so here 3y is equals to 2x you could have done it directly see percentage and percentage will get cancelled 0 and 0 will get cancelled so 3y will be equal to 2x learn to do the things in a easier way okay now so what i will do so y will be nothing but equal to 2 x by 3 okay so here i will put x now i will put this in equation 1 okay see from the equation 1 alone i am not able to answer equation 2 alone i am not able to answer so why i will put 2x by 3 plus 8 now x minus 2x by 3 will be equal to 8 so 3x minus 2x that means x by 3 will be equal to 8 and x will be equal to 24 that means if i am using statement 1 and 2 together if i am using statement 1 and 2 together is sufficient to answer the question so this will become the correct one okay but see uh why i am telling this will be the correct one because either one will be true see either statement one and two is answered or sufficient to answer the question or statement two and three together is sufficient to answer the question okay here they are telling all three together no that is not that all three together all three together is not required we are able to get only from one and two itself okay now if you want to check 2 and 3 so 2 i know 3y is equals to 2x okay and the third one if you'll see the ratio between one third of x is equals to ah sorry the ratio between one third of x and one fourth of y is equals to 2 is to 1 so this will be nothing but okay we have to simplify right so x by 3 and divided by this will become what y by 4 is equals to 2 by 1 okay so now x by 3 into 4 by y is equals to 2 by 1 so 2 2's are so 2x will become equal to 3y so from equation 3 we are getting 3y is equals to 2x so equation 3 also same and equation two also same so we will not be able to solve with the help of two and three so that is also gone okay but if there would have one more option that one and three so statement one and three then that also would have been correct okay but anyway they will not give statement one and two enrichment one and three because only one see both will correct you cannot mark two options right so you have to mark only one option so it will go with only option one here okay so if you have any doubt please put a comment definitely i will try to answer here but whatever questions we have discussed today are very important question and if you learn this then definitely you are going to do well in your examination and friends if you like the video please do comment like and share with your friends so that it will help to each and all who is looking for the free preparation of tcs thank you

Transcript:
hello everyone and i welcome all of you to all and study for you a complete placement solution friends in this video i am going to talk about how to prepare well for the upcoming tcs examination just in 20 days so friends this 20 days plan if you'll keep in mind then nobody can stop you for scoring more than 80 percent in the tcs examination and tcs want 80 percent so that they will be calling you for interview okay so what is the agenda for today's video so i will be telling you free source for practice of your cognitive skills aptitude reasoning and english how to make a perfect plan for 20 days so friends for 2022 batch we have almost a month to prepare and for 2020 2019 and 2021 batch we have another 15 20 days to prepare so this 20 days plan is definitely going to give you a perfect view that how you should prepare so that you will be able to score more than 80 percent in 20 days preparation and tcs would send you uh interview call if you score more than 80 okay so i will take you through the slides so i will tell you how you have to divide the time okay so on aptitude on reasoning and on english okay how you have to divide the time how much you have to practice i will also tell you for aptitude problem learn option attack method okay so friends i see many student in the examination they will be calculating the complete sum and at the end they will not be able to find the complete result okay so i will also tell you how to use okay option attack method and then followed by your source okay uh i will tell you how to get it and then friends is some reasoning question also i will take you through so reasoning question we need to attempt easy topic first okay so you should not get into the complicated topic first okay so that also i'll be telling you and each and every uh link will be given in the description so either source okay and english what you have to do and how we have to prepare so we will be talking in very much detail okay now so friends let us start with our dividing the time so this 20 days plan is definitely going to change everything okay if you follow that so friends we have in cognitive aptitude reasoning and english okay so out of this three scoring will be reasoning and english okay so you cannot score well from aptitude okay so you will be able to score very good marks from english and uh reasoning so you should be able to solve at least 90 percent and people will be able to solve the questions will be very very easy okay you can make it easy i will tell you how we have to study and aptitude definitely it will be little uh compared to reasoning and english so aptitude will be little tough which you need to take care of that okay so friends aptitude daily one hour you study uh you know concepts like suppose you took one topic suppose today i will take percentage so one hour you focus on the concepts and some solved example okay solved example and the very that day itself after that one hour you solve only the question now from where you will get the question that i will be telling you okay so one hour you spend on practicing the question so total two hours right okay reasoning friends reasoning is easy okay so reasoning is easy and scoring as i said so you spend only 30 minutes on the concept and then remaining one hour you solve the question suppose you took a topic direction now direction easily you can do the concepts in 10 minutes you can also spend 30 minutes okay and then one hour you solve at least 15 10 to 15 problems okay this is how you are going to improve okay and then english english see at this point of time new concepts okay in english we cannot you know learn grammar suddenly in few days so english only practice will be required so whatever topics i have listed down so that topic you have to practice i will also tell you which videos i have listed down the topics important topics which will help you to prepare for your english examination okay so total friends in one day you have to spend four and a half hour according to me if you really want a stable job in tcs okay so tcs will ideally give you 25 000 in your hand ideally now some uh some person will tell so i'm working in tcs i'm not getting that much ideality approximately tcs will give you that much of amount so for that 20 days you can spend four hours four and a half hours per day and trust me it will change a lot of things in your life okay if you follow this now so friends whenever the question will be asked in exam i have seen a student what they will do so they will directly jump on some kind of formula they will read the question and then again and again okay see first of all you have to have patience in exam so if you want that then before that only you should have very good practice now this problem you see so find the list number which on being divided by 3 4 5 7 and 8 leaves okay in each case a remainder of 2 but when divided by 11 leaves no remainder okay now so this question was asked in the tcs ninja may 2021 examination okay so you should and must know that divisibility rule of 11 okay divisibility rule of 11. this if you know then that's all done you do not have to take the lcm many students they will start taking the lcm they will start dividing it friends you see first option so four minus four four minus four is equals to zero so first option itself is divisible by eleven second option not divisible third option eight minus nine minus 8 not divisible 9 minus 2 not divisible so only option a will be the correct answer this is called as option attack so this you need to learn it okay see like a normal student what you are doing so you will be taking lcm sir i will take lcm it taking lcm itself will be very much difficult and then putting all this no need to do that see that number is completely divisible by 11 okay and a level 11 divisibility rule says that okay difference of okay so difference of sum of alternate number sum of alternate numbers should be either 0 or divisible by 11 that's all this is a divisibility rule of 11. so if you see sum of alternate numbers so 4 plus 0 okay and then again sum of alternate numbers so 2 plus 2 4 if you take that difference 4 minus 4 is 0 so either it should be 0 or it should be 11 then it is divisible by 11 now this question you can put on google and you can see so friends it's not like i'm trying to you know attract you or something like that no this is the actual question asked in the tcs uh may examination okay if you put on the google somewhere you will be finding out okay the question even in our channel also i have done it so you can verify that so a screen sort of the question i have put it right okay now second question friends average of 15 number is calculated as 50. so 15 number average is 50 that means see average meaning is that means per person is around 50 years this is what is per person is what 50 years it is discovered later that while calculating the average one number 25 was incorrectly entered as 10 okay so by mistake instead of 25 you have you have put 10 so if you put 25 now definitely this average will increase so i could see there is only one option where average is increasing that's all now i know so you have the formula average will be equal to some by number you use it but when you will learn when you will learn this option attack method that is important right you also need to learn this option attack method so that in exam if you don't know the method at least you can go for this option attack method which will help you to solve the question easily okay so average of 50 number is 50 right but it is discovered later now if 15 is increasing right if 15 is increasing that means definitely average will also increase yes or no so i could see more than 50 there is only one option even if you will solve also by normal method you will get the same answer so this is called option attack method which where option is helping you to find out the answer source so friends i have given you the link so m formats this link will be also given in the description so here you can find tcs question previous your question will always help you okay so this kind of questions will only be coming in the exam it is not like you will find very different question like cat mat you know not like that online study for you playlist this link also will give in description if i will give it here it does not have any meaning so even our playlist only if you practice only our playlist of aptitude nobody can stop you in getting a very good marks of around 80 percent in examination if you practice well okay only our playlist nothing else has to be done lot of questions i have done in each and every topic of aptitude so and wherever you are finding previous year question just do it because tcs multiple times repeats the similar kind of question in the examination that i have told you multiple times okay now friends in the reasoning first we have to identify easy topic and then you have to solve it okay so let us uh take the topics like slozism surism you know for most of the student it is confusing but it is very very simple my dear friends i am telling you so this is a question which was asked in again the tcs ninja uh you know march may exam sorry may exam 2021 this year questions friends i'm not doing some three four years before question no you you bring me you bring the question to me i will solve and i will give it to you in a very efficient way okay see solving the questions in exam matters a lot okay you need to save time so some pens are pencil so some of the pens are pencil okay no problem and all pencils are booked and all pencils are books this is a syllogism question which we have to solve using the vein diagram there is multiple ways but if you want to have the correct answer if you want to get the correct answer in the examination then you can use this venter some books are pins okay so some books are pins so books and pens i could see yes so they're crossing each other but yeah first is correct all pens are book all pins are not inside the book by a second is wrong all pencils are pins so all pencils are not inside the pins that's all now tcs will give you marks for this so that is the reason i said you reasoning question will be easy you do not have to worry about that okay now next question next question says so friends this kind of questions you please definitely practice because these are kind of questions are coming continuously in october in march in may all examination it is coming okay so please practice for this question so in each of the five pairs of the letters the letters in the second term are a re arranged transformed for the letters in the first term in particular pattern in which two pairs has the information uh transformation has been done in the same way okay now so friends you can see proud okay so what you do you write here one two three four five okay one two three four five and here you see so uh 1 2 right so 2 is here how they have arranged and then 5 is here then 4 is here p is what 1 and o is what 3. so you do it here itself ok you write it and then you do it ok it will be easy one two three four five so here it will become i i is two h h is four t is five r is one and g is uh g is three okay done and then say so one two three four five okay now so h is nothing but two three r is four s is one and e is five then one two three four five this is the easy way to do it o is two h if you mark it that's all you will be able to get the answer easily okay that's all done now you could see so 2 5 2 5 4 1 3 right so 2 5 4 1 3 so a and d has the same pattern so you can mark a and d that's all option c will be the correct answer the fifth one you do not have to check it source so again friends m for math so then only you will be getting question for reasoning also online study for you playlist has a lot of questions and previous your question wherever you see you should be able to do it okay and then friends after that we have english so only practice question and i will also tell you how to get all the topics okay

Guys, I am a 2021 passout. Having cleared Nqt I got a ninja offer. Apart from that I have got offers from mindtree,Accenture and cognizant. I just want to tell to the people who are preparing for nqt to mainly focus on all sections rather than focusing only on coding. Coding is one of the criteria but not the only one. I wasn't able to solve even 1 coding question successfully due to a compiler issue. Despite that I got an interview call up. So please focus on aptitude, reasoning, English etc. Just sharing my experience so that it may help some of you. All the best.
Edit : Try to solve at least one coding question successfully. It should be enough.
Compiler issues are very common in NQT. Be careful. Better to use C,C++.

https://youtube.com/watch?v=lzOz6Q60g4I

Transcript:
hi hello everyone welcome back to online study for you a complete placement solution so guys there is an important update or some important information that you must know like 2020 second batch must know about vipro nlth allied okay because if you don't know these kind of instruction there is a high chance you will not be getting a selection or your application will not be getting submitted to this particular opinion okay there are so much students from us from our students who have suffered this for 2020 first passing out and 20 and 90 passing on patch without taking into consideration of these kind of instructions or information they have missed their opportunity they couldn't apply at the time of registration okay so since they have missed this opportunity okay so uh it is exclusively for 2020 second past students so you only will be there no competition from 21st and 20th and 19th patch students so there's a high chance if you go through all the instructions and if you obey all those kind of things by registration you will get to uh attend it and uh you know it is examinations used to be moderate so you will pass it anyway and you will get pleased okay so so let's see now what are those kind of things so one by one let's go to the instructions and uh all the dates things okay so first we have the events so events in this tenant days are they that are starting off registration process usually occurs on second week of december and it will be there till third week of january like you will be getting approximately of one month duration for the registration so once the link is out you have to make your registration at the earliest make sure that all the documents are there with you in the sense resuming then your passport says photo all these kind of primary documents are there okay get scanned copies carry it in your phone itself or make it your drive like when you are not in home if something happened you must be able to do it right so just carry the soft copy with you every time because hard copy will not be able like will not be there in our hands every time okay so now coming to the date of online assessment third week of january 2022 okay that is online assistant after registration you will not be getting enough time for the preparation of chan on an assessment okay like you will be thinking okay after registration i will just uh prepare so it is not like that and also the time of november december and january university used to schedule their final i mean uh this semester examination so at that time you will be messing up these things with us so now we're still if we just start preparing for these kind of complete examination for the aptitude programming everything like half an hour to one hour a day you can spend before that okay so this will definitely help you at that time you'll be having online like a university examination so don't mess it up with and lose these kind of opportunities okay now declaration of result will be from fourth week of january soon after the online assessment is done so now next we have some things like what is the content of the online assessment okay so here the total duration is 128 minutes three sections will be there that is first section is aptitude test that test will be having logical ability will be evaluated quantitative ability then english verbal ability some kind of proportions uh will be missing and you have to feel that some kind of comprehension passages will be given you have to read and know about it and give the answers those kind of english verbal liberty will be there and next uh this total duration for this is 48 minutes and next we'll be having written communication test as a writing uh that is 20 minutes okay you'll be giving one topic or you will be getting one statement you should do and after that from with that you have to uh write an essay with a limited time of 20 minutes okay next we'll be having online programming test to this you will be having two programs for coding okay you can choose which programming language that you should take care of uh from java c c plus plus or python okay so if you uh like which you if you don't know all these kind of languages you can start learning it from now it's not take any of the language one language is completely fine you can just brush up the basic knowledge and basic programming things that is enough and more no complex we pro don't use to evaluate student or online programming test is not that high level it's easy to moderate kind of things okay so programming test is basically you have to pressure for the logic like you should get the logic kind of things and the duration is 60 minutes you'll be having two questions to go and you have to compile and run the programs so this is the basic things and next why it is important to know all these kind of informations okay that is there is a simple clause put forwarded by them that is no backlogs criteria at the time of registration so now most of the students will be writing their examination like online or offline whatever more it is so you will be attending your semester examination and before it does uh we pro allied scheduled you will be writing another set of online examinations semester examination too it can be online and offline so make sure that if you are a pair enough if you are planning to go for big pro or applied for that or if you are planning to go for any kind of placement things you should not get the backlogs from now okay if you have backlogs currently you try to clear it at the earliest but if you have any kind of backlogs or any kind of examinations to come make sure that you don't get any kind of batteries okay if you got at the last moment then you your registration itself won't be successful so this is the important instruction that you should keep in your mind from today to apply at the time of listening so now we'll be having next status candidates who have participatory any selection process held by the pro in the last six months are not eligible so this designation is for the project engineer so when you are like if this is your designation you should not apply for any kind of uh these vip pro for the past months like nowadays if any applications from the vipro uh job sections with pro career section if any updations come if you are a 2022 passing out student and if you plan to apply for the allied national hunt then you should not apply for this time okay from now you should don't try to attend attend any kind of things okay now it's of course a competitive examination so you must prepare well so you try to find where you are we get when your we get this or that and try to do it okay now no second option okay that is 2022 uh bad students they'll be hiring only once and the next time when they're going for that uh it will be marrying for 20 21 and 22 so you will be getting like you will be having more number of competition it is now 4 22 only so competitions are very less so you will be getting to crack it easily okay so these are the important things that you should keep in mind from today to apply for the vipro a night which is about to fall on december now moving on to the qualification all these kind of things aspirant should have any of the following degrees that is b b tech five in five years integrated empty so these are the qualification criteria for this particular thing okay now the branch of study will be candidates should have completed their be they take five years integrated and tech degree in csit or circuit fields okay that is computer science related branches and com circuited phase is what they are looking forward for and the designation to go on with this project engineer okay so i think all these kind of informations are clear so here you can see like application must have a complete graduation in 2022 yeah designation selected candidates will be recruited as project engineer compensation will be 3.450 lakhs annum now service agreement will be there will have to sign a service agreement for 12 months post joining at uh 75 000 on provider basis that is if you are breaking this board you have to give the compensation okay so this is about the details regarding that so i think all the details which i've mentioned is clear to you here to your knowledge so what is the point of making this a reminder or other thing is that i have already mentioned that because now it is a month of uh july so you have august november and just about three months to go so if you keep these things in mind now only you will be successfully accepting uh registering to repo there are so much students who have uh got discarded from the registration they have registered but their registration have been got some problems and they couldn't register well okay so which is very important to know about this all these kind of things just five to ten minutes spend it and okay so that's about it so share this video among your friends who is passing out in 2022 they also should know about all these kind of things before applying to vipre okay so that's all for today if you have any further doubts or clarifications to be done please do mention in the comment section i'll definitely look into that and also suggest regarding the video content well welcome to the conversation so until we meet again everybody stay safe stay happy and stay tuned to online study for you

hello everyone and i welcome all of you to online study for you a complete placement solution friends today we have chanchal tiwari with us and she has got selected in hermann with a package of five lakhs per annum and today she is here with us and she is going to share her experience that how did she apply for hermann and how was the written round how was the interview experience so everything she will be sharing here so watch the video till the end to understand everything so congratulation uh chanchal for getting selected in hermann thank you sir so the floor is completely used now so uh please explain like how did you apply for hermann and the written and the interview experiences so everything we wanted to hear from you sure sir thank you sir thank you everyone hello sir and hello everyone i am kolkata i am an ec student from mccabe institute of engineering and uh i have applied for harman connected services through through litmus ph test so in the month of march on 28th march i have given my elite ph test and uh after one month aprox you will get your result and some resources and some searches i found out that in the month of june or june or july basically most of the companies come in litmus for recruitment procedure so harman came in the month of june at the starting of the june you can say first or second june and was the first company okay before that i wanted to uh you know ask you something so you wrote uh elite much test right okay so uh actually our viewers also like definitely they would like to know so like how many questions were there which all sections were there and what was the duration and marks and moreover what was your ph score uh because based on your ph score only company will uh be con if you apply com company will be selecting you yeah so you want some information on that yes sir sure so litmus ph stress is basically divided in three sections first section is quantitative second is problem solving and third is verbal so each section consists of 20 questions and you have 200 marks allocated for each sections so in grand total you have 60 questions and 600 marks for litmus ps test and my score was 93 percentile and uh thank you sir and yes difficulty level is uh more than mcat and co cubes compared because litmus is better than those as far as i know many companies come in litmus for recruitment so difficulty level will be uh greater than mcat and co-cubes for a reason okay so we had like quantitative aptitude problem solving and verbal ability each 20 20 questions and the total marks were 60 and what was the time allocated for uh these three so two hours 120 minutes you will be given okay great great okay so now you can start with like harman how did you you know like uh you applied and you got the caller messages from them yeah uh so as i mentioned earlier in the starting of the june i applied for harman and based on the ps4 as you mentioned they will recruit you so i got a mail from elitmus uh seven days later that you have been shortlisted for harman connected services and in that particular mail i have been given a link for online assessment written test which was of c plus okay and yes it was of c plus plus because i mentioned c plus plus it is not mandatory that the c plus plus exam will be for every month it will be based on your resume whatever you will be mentioning in your resume they will take a written exam mcq type of that particular language suppose you have been uh you have mentioned java or python so they will take mcq type exam on that which i was having c plus plus so they have taken c plus plus mcq assessment test so what kind of questions are the students should prepare uh like mcqs so they had output finding or error or something like that yes basically in that written exam if i will mention in detail i was having 30 questions in that written exam and the time allocated for that was 35 to 40 minutes and coming to your question what type of question there was uh there was basically finding uh subjective mcqs okay so for each question you will be given a code and the code length will be smaller greater based on that question and in that particular code you will be uh you will be ha you will have to find the error the output and uh so on so this is a not uh simple mcq it was subjective it was also difficulty level was not easy it was moderate to difficult okay so then after how many days you got the result and how many rounds were conducted for your interview okay so so after a c plus plus written test i think one or two days later i got a mail from hermann that you are selected for technical round interview and uh in interview in my interview round there was okay before that okay three rounds okay okay yeah first was technical second was managerial ground and third was hr okay so what all questions were there in technical round and uh i mean accordingly like those who are appearing for hermann they will prepare so for how many duration each rounds and what all questions were there okay so the all the candidates and the viewers who are willing to apply for connected services i will suggest that they should have a good knowledge about tsa and that is object oriented uh programming concept in my technical interview it was of one hour and it was on zoom platform and uh there was one to one there was one to one interview one man was there and she has asked me about method overloading method overriding polymorphism encapsulation uh class object and yes for each question you have to show the code in your notepad by sharing the screen it is not like a simple definition type that what is encapsulation you just say the definition and that's all no you have to also show the code accordingly for each and all questions so you mean like you have to some real kind of example like encapsulation so we can code like this so these guys to make them understand you have to show the real life example by showing the code so it went for one hour yes great okay so you had the mr round same day or it was on the same day i was having my mr round uh i think one hour later i got a call from hermann that you have cleared your pr and you are selected for managerial round and which will be scheduled on the same day so at the evening 4 30 p.m i was having my managerial round and it was a interview with one of the senior analyst of permanent connective services and he also asked me about oops concept c plus plus about my project and some questions like work from home is efficient or but from office is better like that questions and also coding questions were there okay and uh yeah and two days later i was having my hr mam called me that you are having an hr round today only on 12 30 ah 12 30 pm i was having my hr round and hrm was not that long it was basically of 15 to 20 minutes and there was some formality questions like where do you live what is your permanent state uh when your exams will end so all these questions are you are you able to relocate to bangalore and all these questions because uh at my time hermann connected services was uh recruiting for bangalore location specifically okay so finally like after how many days of your hr round you got the mail that yes yes so actually two or three days later i logged in elite first and if in elitemas and then my status changed to offer and i thought i firstly i didn't understand and but then when i googled i was very happy that yes i got a chance to work with herman connected services and uh yeah and then also on the same day i got a mail from hermann that an offer later basically from hermann connective services and it was okay two or three days later after my hr okay so the last question to you is so how did you see online study for you helped in achieving uh or in your journey to getting selected in hermann so actually i have no words to explain i am very helpful and i'm very thankful to online study for you because in the month of december 2020 i joined your aptitude class uh which was of uh one month online duration was of one month and it was of great help and my attitudes was not that was not that good but after joining your class my aptitude went very good i was able to solve the questions and yes your short tricks through the all the chapters to all the topics has helped me a lot in cracking the elements exam and also on the on the same month i also joined sridhar search coding class which was also of one month and uh his c plus first concept dsa concept has also helped me a lot in my technical interview so in summary i can say that yes online study for you has been a very great help for me to tracking this placement thank you chinchill and uh for coming here and explaining your journey to the student and trust me it is going to help many of them uh those who wanted to you know companies like herman which is a very good company like mean people wanted to get placed in companies like

Good class🥰
Thanks sir
Please make a crash course video sir
Sir, why didn't you have a mobile app ? Your channel deserves it...
Sir at 19:16  you have divide the whole term  by 0.9  but   before you have multiply 1.5 with 240%   so shouldn't  we have to multiply the term with 0.9 instead of divide by it ?   
And  then the answer  will be option b  ( 0.01) 
Please clear my doubt

which is what is this nqt what is actually what can we do if you don't have a scorecard okay so now if i'm coming to the nqp this is the national qualifier test okay that is tcs inquiry djs is initiating this national qualifier test and if you just got a cut-off mark i mean ah they are you you're you're not getting compared to other candidates but there's a cut-off score and if you have greater than that these companies will be hiring and if you're greater than that that companies will be having this is the normal structure of intuitive okay so when you apply for nqt with that score card that you will be getting a scorecard when you enter the online assessment uh of this entity then with that scorecard you can appear for so much companies like so much of companies uh for this two years because that scorecard is valid for two long years okay so this is the national qualifier test link okay that is here if you are not registered to it add if you have not attended any kind of nqt like 2022 batch 21st patch 20th batch 19th whoever it is if you are not applied to any kind of enquiries then you can apply it here the link will be there in the description okay now here you can see you can just click on this apply now button and get it today there are so much steps a few of the steps that you have to take care of while applying for that so regarding that a registration step was i have already did a video when this link uh first came into existence the lending link was active so that video the link everything i'll be giving in the description you can watch this video and apply if you have not applied to it and okay so you can have to apply for this position uh for this nqt and after that they you will be getting a mail regarding your online assist match you will be attending the online assessment after that you will be getting a scorecard with respect to your mark criteria you will be getting entry to different companies if it is this cut off you will be getting into tcs if this is cut or you can apply for the company if this is cut off then you can for apply for other company so this is how it works and if you have a thesis and qt uh scorecard with you and if it you gained it within this uh past two years then you can apply if i mean the score has a validity of two years so if that is valid then you can apply to the shop carnival via your scorecard mail and to check the validity of your mail you can just prostrate the mail where you got the s this nqt scorecard okay and also if you don't have the scorecard don't worry you can apply it uh to the sport drill and get in the examination and get a scorecard and apply it okay so this is about if you have a scorecard and if you have don't have any scorecard what to do and how to do it okay now there was so much other comments too like if you select on this whether we have to go for payment or not obviously yes enquiry is now paid we cannot do anything uh you have to buy these variants then you will be getting to uh and then the examination for this particular variant and after that you'll be getting a scorecard so you have to apply the form that is registration form giving all your personal details and also selecting the month of examination that is this nqt is going to happen on august and november so you can choose which month to go for that and this is the nqt platform and you have to select this cognitive industry all these and industry and qt then subject among this you can select yours which you have to get it and after that you can buy then do the payment and do the registration okay if you do the payment only your registration will be successful then only you will be getting the online assessment link hence attending the examination if you have not did the payment only the profile registration is done then you will be your profile only will be available you will not be getting uh the complete registration that is you will not be getting an online assessment link to go okay so this is about it and there are so much other questions like uh i'm from bse department i'm from bcom i'm from b am from m-tech uh how am i eligible here or not all these kind of things all these kind of things you can choose is by yourself because this entity scorecard is a mandatory thing that you have to get okay so when you go for this mqtt registration there are so much graduations available masters you gpg everyone can apply it in this enquiry everyone can attend the examination get an entry discord card okay because if you are id student you have to select among this you will be selected programming basic computer cells and if you're a mechanical student still you wish to get into id sector you have to select some of the variants from this and all these so selecting the variants is important which you should select to getting companies and which is important which you should compulsorily select which you should select according to graduation type all these kind of things that is variance tcc and qt variant selection all these kind of details i have discussed in my previous video there is an exclusive video for that like a simple video for uh this video that's a link i'll give it the description you can just watch this video selecting the variants because how to select the variants what should i buy all these kind of questions were there in the comment section okay so if you have any confusions regarding that you can go with the link and watch the video and know about it and register okay so it is very important to get uh thesis variants according to your preference according to graduation type and according to the domain which you wish to get into it okay so that is about the variance too so now you got to register you selected the media you did the payment and you got everything and you got the score you attended the online examination that you're getting a scorecard with that you can apply it here okay so now to this current job carnival event by theseus ion uh if you this is only applicable for this month this one only this job carnival will be taking place but don't worry make sure that you have an qt scorecard with you

click on this load more and get so much of them okay so then after you can apply it then okay so now you can see here uh all these things regarding the application step everything is given my previous video if you have not watched it you can go with that and also if you have so much queries regarding this job carnival you can just see the general questions section here okay what is tcsi on virtual job where all this kind of thing and one of the relevant question that we got is how to apply for that okay what is the application you can see after getting shortlisted but cooperative what is that next next step and all these kind of things okay so this is about here so again get the application however it will be uh apply everything from here okay so now let's see few of them so you can see one link here like after registration how will i get notified so this is the relevant thing once you register an email notification will be shared with you along with the details of the event and link to apply for the jobs will be sent or emailed after application steps hrs will shortlist your profile and you will get notifications on your registered email id okay so first thing you have to take care of you have to register for this particular opening you can just go with the link which i've mentioned in the description and also uh how to register for uh independent companies uh like this okay into this independent companies i have discussed in my previous video you can just go and see the job details from this link you will get to know the job details and like which eligibility criteria all those kind of 18 and you can go for apply and all and yes after register when you register for this particular job you'll be getting a mail okay through that mail you can apply for that company so registration is done from this portrait after that you will be getting a mail after that you can apply for the job openings okay so that's it so similarly you can see so much of queries regarding this theses ion is provided here you can just cross check and get all your queries done so you can see that what is the registration paper jesus i own so it is completely free right now this is not charging anything but for the nqt you have to get some variance you can to make the payment and buy some value okay what is the total number of corporates participating in the i on all these kind there are more than 10 corporates participating do i need to prefer uh prepare for the event before attending what are the steps to be followed yes canada's must be fully prepared prior to participating in the carnival a few things to keep in mind is keep your online profile ready have scanned documents up to date be dressed formally check your system internet make sure that they are working properly for a smooth experience check your browser and login before the event starts so there is no room for error keep your webcam ready and make sure there is no minimal disturbance in the background okay so here uh all the details regarding this uh registration from registration to the interview okay end of the interview everything is provided here so you can just cross check those two okay basic details regarding the registration step and how to go that all that i have discussed in my previous video if you have any further doubts you can just go through all these kind of general questions as well okay now you can see coming to the thesis in qt and there was some uh some random doubts regarding like uh i'm from 2020 20 bad 2022 match okay that is 2020 22. so i don't have any scorecard how can i get it the very own answer you can just apply at the examination and get so when you attend the online examination obviously you will be having some kind of coding questions to go you know that all an assessment will be having attitude reasoning and coding kind of questions right so if you wish to get the guidance for coding we can definitely help you with that we have our live coding classes which is about to start today but you can make your enrollment it's a live coding class like timing is from seven to eight it is satisfying basic to advance level on hands-on coding everything is available so this will help you uh to attend online assessment coding sections because it is applicable for any badge like any mechanical or any kind of you can interest in this course and know about the coding side and attend your online examination successfully so we pro enforcers tcs accenture capturing for all these companies coding is very important so obviously you will get to uh know about it and you will able to grant the online assessment for that as well and since tcs and qt is going to be scheduled i mean it said scheduled on august like the next month so there are some uh freshly prepared materials for them as well so live classes plus recordings will be available to you materials will be available more people will be available and whole of this package is available to you at just 2.49 so it's completely worth you can just try it and the link to a register for this will be there in the description register prepare well for your online examination because once you attend on an examination like six months to nine months you will not be able to attend the examination again for this particular company so you'll be missing the chances so don't take risk while you register attend it after preparing well okay so that's all about this course so now coming back to our topic okay so now there were some questions like uh yes uh sufficient 202 badges and all so you can just go and apply so coming to the collaborations of this tcs company so these are the branches and not only these branches there are so much others to you can see and more is provided like these is coming public sapiens my faces everyone is coming like so much of companies are available here so you can just go with that okay so uh as i've mentioned the registration step is to be carried out in so much multiple steps all these kind of things is very important so watch the video regarding all these kind of things which i have given the description and know about it and register okay so once more i'm reminding that obviously if you are a job seeker like of these companies like tcs and all so if then you definitely have to go for nqt because you have to make the payment there is no free uh right now you have to buy this variance and register yourself so uh obviously if you go with that if you're a job seeker as i've mentioned with this scorecard you can apply for two long years for two long years you can just use the scorecard and apply for different companies so obviously it works it is having a greater importance the scorecard okay so not only for this carnival obviously in every cycle this carnival kind of things is happening with so much companies okay according to score you will get to uh know which company you will be getting placed okay so that's about some of the queries that are received i think i have covered major of them like most of them was i don't have any how can i apply all these kind uh so i have already mentioned all these kind of things so you have to register then you will be getting a mail you can even check the uh jobs or uh yes the companies which is available and you can just try linking applying for that too and you'll be getting a mail to apply for this particular company and you can go with that okay so now one more thing is important thing is which batch eligible okay so which batch relationship in the sense uh don't worry if you have an equity score valid and activity score away but your bad should belong to you can apply it okay so that's about it and also i'm not able to register every time it says something wrong uh how to deal with it i think you have completed your registration and you might have got a mail to apply for this company and then with that link you just try applying for the company too okay try that way also and also if make sure that the login id login id in the sense here when you apply for that you have to log in i have not currently logged in since i'm not having any uh valid nqp scorecard with me so if you have you'll be getting that profile you can log in with that profile and you should have that then you will be eligible and also just go through the lgbt criteria you can just click on this job details and go through the eligibility criteria there they will be giving the kind of things that you should know and with that details also you can keep on trying okay so first step that you have to take care is you have to register then then you will be getting the mail to apply for all of the things okay so in previous video i have given some number like customer care number uh for the customer care so you can go with that as well and also if you have any queries related to easies or you know there are some general questions that are given so much of them you can just go through the questions and check whether the same question you have in your mind or not and according to this these nqt scorecard is the main question that i've got i don't have the scorecard how can i apply i have the scorecard from this year how can i make use of that card or not and i don't have the scorecard but still i want to try what should i do how can i get the scorecard all these kind of questions so these questions was much more relevant because that is not provided in any kind of general question criteria so that is the main thing that i should answer so i think i have given answers to all of your questions so yes if you have any further more please go through this general question session and also still more if you have you can just cross check with us and if we have the answers then we'll be connected to tcsd man will be answering and if we have the answers we will be definitely answering us or if you don't have you can just respond to the mail like you can just send the mail to them itself regarding to the queries or else i have mentioned one toll free number one customer care number in my previous video so we can just call that number and ask your queries okay because that number is very responsive they used to respond to the customers okay so that's about the questions responding to a query section so i think i have did it so until we meet again with so much of opportunities available across everybody stay safe stay happy and stay tuned to online study for you

=== TCS Repeats Questions from this topics only | TCS Most Asked Topics | TCS NQT August 2021 ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=zbkG1dqrnjM

Transcript:
hello everyone and i will come all of you to one and study for you a complete placement solution friends this is pratik sirvastava here and today i am going to talk on a very important topic okay so friends as you know the tcs exam is planned in august and november 2021 now we have very limited time okay so today i will be discussing about what all attitude topics are important which you should do first or which you should only prepare for the examination so aptitude and reasoning topic also i will be talking so friends if you see 24 plus 13 there are total 37 topics are there per day okay so there are total 37 topics are there so per day if you go through one topic also you do not have sufficient time for your upcoming tcs examination okay so friends important attitude and reasoning topic for tcs nqt august and november exam 2021 okay so read the topic from where the question comes so you should and must know which topic more number of question comes so that you can prepare accordingly okay see one thing is very much true you cannot be master of all the topics okay so nobody so even i teach aptitude from long time okay but i am also not a master of all the topics of aptitude and the reasoning which i told 37 topics definitely i'm not the master of that okay so friends here what we have to do is we have to do a smart work okay see do not do hard work if you keep doing hard work then you won't be able to score more in your examination okay so we will talk on all these points you also know friends so for every question in the examination there is some certain time limit is there so within that time limit we need to solve so visual topic we cannot which are topic questions we cannot solve in 1.4 minute okay that also we will discuss so each and everything we will discuss watch the video till the end and if you follow this video okay whatever has been said in this video if you follow the same then definitely you will be doing well in your upcoming tcs nqt august and november examination okay so watch the video till the end to understand more i will also tell you which all type of question will be asked from you in the exam so friends the first topic comes simplification right in aptitude so from here you can expect two to three question so this topic you prepare well okay in simplification you can see we have decimal board mass square square root cube roots search and indices previous year problem multiplication division technique so basically simplification you should and must do because two to three questions will come percentage so percentage will be used across the complete mathematics so percentage also you should do number system you can avoid okay see i will be telling you the topics which is most important so first you can do this topic and then if the time permits then you can go for the topic which i am crossing okay but i am not saying the questions won't come from this see from number system rarely the questions will come but if the question comes okay one question will be coming so this topic either you can look at the end or you can skip the topic first you can you should go for the important topics then problems on average and ratio and proportion okay then partnership and shares so questions on this topic will be rare so you can do it at the end data interpretation for tcs it is not very very important okay see for other examination if you are writing infosys or any other exam then i will say data interpretation is one of the very very important topic but what you can do is so i have done a video on data interpretation okay so that you can only one video so that you can do it so i will not say it is most important so only one video is more than sufficient for your data interpretation question you do not have to practice a lot profit and loss yes the question will be definitely there from the profit and loss scf and lcm topic you can leave it time and work topic yes so time and work and pipe and system is same unit digit problems is not been asked remainder theorem has not been asked logarithms not been asked and from here then simple and compound interest is a very very important topic so you can see one two three four five six seven so out of 15 topics the seven topics or a topics you can leave it and the remaining you can prepare okay so percentage also you will be getting two questions okay problems on average you will be getting only one question but average is an easy topic see there are two things friends see i will just give an example so even though you know time and distance okay problems on trains boats and a stream we know there will be one question okay two two question but these topics are quite complicated it's not straightforward and even mixture and delegation so mixer and delegation i will say do not do it okay do it at the end only okay so one to two questions will come okay but the concepts are you know quite used and it is quite lengthy so from all the topic together you will be getting one to two question okay so this kind of topics even though you are very good at but in exam you don't know you will be able to solve in the time limit or not but if i will talk about problems on edges if i will talk about problems on average if i will talk about ratio and proportion if we have done then definitely you will be able to solve the question in the examination because this question cannot be make very difficult okay the questions on these topics cannot be twisted a lot okay so cannot be twisted a lot but the questions on time speed and distance on boards and stream this kind of topics mixer and delegation the question can be twisted a lot and there definitely you will be wasting your time and you won't be able to solve see anyway time is fixed so you need to attempt all the topics but from where's your sort questions you will be able to do that i am telling okay so this was clear so this three again you do at at the end or so you can go with the other topics whatever is explained permutation and combination and probability now the early question is seeing okay so this you do add the end again okay then statistics is one of the very very important topic without this you do not go for exam okay so statistics is a very very important topic so please do not write the exam without preparing for this particular topic even in normal questions so i will take you through the question so you will be able to understand what i am saying so yesterday uh i had uploaded one video okay so tcs enquiry question asked in june 20 or 21 exam so you can see this is a question on uh edges okay so problems on edges so sunutika has three brothers this question is again we have median here so now statistics they have started introducing in each and everything okay and friends the what you can do is so you can open youtube okay and then online study for you and you can find the video on okay and then you can find the video on statistics okay which i have done or you can directly type like this so online study for you statistics okay so statistics question for tcs enquiry 2021 okay and this is complete data interpretation so these are the two topics which you should and must um watch okay starting without statistics you are not going to do anything in the examination okay so i hope this will be clear to you then friends okay so strategy is very very important problems and trends mensuration do it at the end mixture and delegation do it and okay permutation and probability is a easy topic these are easy and doable so you need to understand which is easy and doable that you have to complete first so these two topics also you can consider okay so friends i have marked down these topics so statistics problems and edges permutation and combination probability okay simplification percentage ages average proportions ratio proportions okay and then time and walk and then simple and compound interest so from this kind of topics the question will be more so if you see here so there is a ad for five seconds no problem okay so you you can see the first question is from simple interest okay and then we have the questions from and then we have the questions from your uh compound interest and simple interest and then again we will have two more questions will be there one question from ratio and proportion and another question will be from uh i'll just tell you okay so this you can look at this right and then fourth question is from ratio and proportion and then we will have fourth question from profit and loss okay so friends all these topics are very very important which i am asking you to work on that okay so profit and loss okay once you are done with this then we will have a reasoning topic okay so then we will have reasoning so friends if you are writing tcs exam then try to score more and more from reasoning so the first so if i will talk about which subject in cognitive you will be able to score more so reasoning okay so reasoning you will be able to score the maximum marks okay because the questions on the reasoning will be easy and then you will be able to score from aptitude okay then you will be able to score from aptitude and then you will be able to score from verbal because for many people english will be a troubling one so i will say so it depends upon you if you are good at verbal then it will change so attitude and verbal will change so for many people reasoning and then verbal and then aptitude but if you're good at aptitude okay then aptitude and then at the end verbal you will be able to score okay now so friends reasoning topics are easy here also we should have a proper decision that which topic we should focus more so friends direction direction is a very easy topic so only one hour of class you will become the master of direction even though the questions will be less from direction but i will ask you to definitely do this topic because in one hour you can learn complete direction blood relation is very very important okay so it is very very important questions will be there alphabetical series you can do at the end or without doing also if you are if you do not have time you can go to exam number series is a good topic that you should do analysis the questions won't be there ranking and order yes so questions will be there critical reasoning also question will be there but chances of doing mistake in critical reasoning will be more okay so but anyway you look at at the end okay because even though you prepare too much good or too much well in critical reasoning part but we cannot say it is it will be correct or not okay so this you have to take a chance here then figure based problem so figure based problem yes you have to do coding and decoding will again i will say so this is a very important and easy see reasoning the thing is so the topics will be important and easy but in aptitude the topics will be important but it will be difficult as well okay some topic but reasoning all the topics will be easy decision making yes so there were two questions where there two questions were there from decision making okay number puzzles want to be there sitting arrangement yes and serialism so in serialism there were two to three questions were there from citizen decision making there by two questions were there okay number series one question were there blood relation two questions were there okay so like these questions will be there in the exam coding and decoding so coding and decoding you will have two to three questions okay so friends this is the weightage of the topic so coding and decoding surrealism sitting arrangement one two two questions were there okay so different different shifts where they're based on that i am telling so you can leave only alphabetical analysis critical reasoning and then prince cerosism is very very important so if you do not have a very good concept of seriousness then please learn okay so here you can see tcs nqt 2021 uh reasoning questions okay so reasoning analysis we have done so see this kind of syllabism questions will be asked in the examination so question number one is from synonym question number two is from venn diagram question right so friends all those things you have to watch okay and then question number three uh was from coding and decoding okay and then question number four again from syracism right socialism more number of questions were asked okay so that's how i have done question number four and then again add started so till then the ad will be coming i will tell you uh so friends we have started with your coding uh in hindi okay so coding tcs and qt coding we are doing the previous year uh questions of the coding in hindi and that is on the channel nakari for you so if you have not uh you know gone through this then please go through so here we are completely doing in hindi so your coding and your aptitude also will be started from today so attitude and coding everything we will be doing in the hindi so this channel if you have not subscribed it do subscribe okay and then you will be able to get this all this kind of innovative videos okay now friends so reasoning i was telling you so then fifth question is again from cyrillicism and then sixth question uh if you'll see then it is from data sufficiency okay so friends data sufficiency i will not say it is a different topic so data sufficiency if you're good at the basics thing then data sufficiency is that topic okay so data sufficiency is not a very different topic altogether so just go through all these videos and definitely you will be able to learn a lot of things so friends this analysis should and must definitely tell you that how should you prepare for your tcs upcoming august and november examination okay and friends we have also started with uh aptitude and coding live classes the link will be given in the description okay so please do check the description because without checking descriptions only i see many of the comments will come and if you like the video friends then definitely do share with your friends subscribe it if you have not subscribed and we will be coming up with uh different videos okay and if you want me to solve the questions on these topics then please do comment also because i wanted to help you in all possible ways okay but when we upload a video okay and when the views goes less so if you see the videos which we uploaded yesterday it has only three thousand views so when the views will be less we will also think so we are putting effort and people are not either appreciating or people are not watching it okay but see this raising videos on the other hand it has good views okay 26 000 people had watched it okay and definitely so we were doing at this that time so now also if you wanted uh me to do then definitely i'll be doing it for you guys so please

Transcript:
hello everyone and i welcome all of you to on and study for you a complete placement solution friends this is pratik srivastava here and in our today's video i am going to discuss tcs nqt june 2021 question so friends in the month of june tcs has conducted examination for a few of them so we have got the recent question so if you are new to this channel please do subscribe because we are doing the complete previous year problem of tcs of aptitude coding and english okay so today we are going to discuss aptitude problem which were asked in the june 2021 examination okay so let us start with question number one so friends question number one is from the topic simple and compound interest okay and friends this question is repeated so exactly not the question the pattern okay so only the data were changed okay so only the data were changed but the same question has been come exactly multiple times in the tcs examination so if you do previous your question then it is sufficient to crack the tcs examination so a certain sum of money invested at simple interest amounts to rupees 990 in three years so friends suppose you had x rupees okay and you invested in bank for three years okay so after three years bank is giving you 990 rupees okay and the same money okay a certain sum of money invested at simple interest amounts to rupees 990 in three years and to rupees 1125 in four and half year so the same money is giving you okay so hundred so thousand to 125 rupees in four and half years okay four and a half years so this is what has been told in the question so friends for solving aptitude two things is very very important understand the question and whatever data has been given in the question just write down here your 50 percent of the question is solved here itself this question is very very easy but because i'm explaining you so that is the reason i am going through all these phases okay now so friends we can see here in one and a half years see three years 990 and 125 in four and a half years so i can say that in okay in one and a half year the interest is what one one two 5 minus 990 okay this why we are doing because the question has been given in simple interest if the same question would have given in compound interest then the process will be different because in case of simple interest your principle will be same your principle will be same and because your principle is same so your rate of interest also will be same okay so this is the fundamental of simple and compound interest so one and a half year so one and a half year i can also say three by two years so in three by two yes the interest will be five twelve minus nine is three and ten minus nine is one so four and half minus three is one enough one and half i can also say three by two years now so in one year what will be interest so in one year the interest will be 135 divided by three by two so this two will go up now 45 times 45 into 2 will be 90 rupees okay so one year the interest will be nothing but 90 rupees okay so when still here you should not have any confusion or if you have any doubt please put in the comment box so you invested x rupees and after three years bank is giving you 990 rupees okay so in three years how much interest you want so x rupees you invested okay for three years so in one year bank is giving you 90 rupees interest so in three years you would have got three into nineties rupees interest and bank including your principal and interest would have given you 990. so x will be equal to 990 minus 270 which is nothing but equal to uh 720 rupees that means your principle was 720 rupees which we have calculated now we know the formula of simple interest will be equal to prt by 100 okay so principal is nothing but 720 rate we have to calculate time is one year okay 100 and simple interest for one year is what so simple interest for one year is 90. so 98 times so rate will be hundred by eight which is nothing but twelve point five percentage so twelve point five percentage means option d will be the correct answer this problem is not this lengthy so from here itself you can see so four and a half years and three years that means in one and half years the interest okay the interest will be nothing but one one two five minus 990 is 135 rupees so one year it is 90 rupees so see this big calculation we have done just in two steps okay now so x plus 3 into 90 that means 270 so x will become 990 minus 270. so it is 720 and then the last calculation is here so friends in four to five lines within 30 to 40 seconds you will be able to do the problem in examination but here you need to understand the basics how do we tackle the problem in the examination okay what kind of problems will be asked so that is what we are learning here now question number two is a problem from the topic is this okay so edges this is a very simple question so it is his question always when you will read you you'll feel like you might not be able to solve so what is the median h so okay so this kind of terms will be given but one thing which i wanted to tell you now tcs is focusing more on statistics okay so tcs is focusing more on statistics so you need to be very very careful okay now so shrutika has three brothers and three sisters okay shrutika has three brothers and three sisters okay so you can see hamdu hamaredu is not there three brothers and three sisters and one surutika total seven okay now so shrutika has three brothers and three sisters her two brothers are two years and four years younger than her and one brother she's two years older than her okay her sister is four years five years and seven years older than her sukhita is sorry sritika is 15 years old so shrutika is nothing but 15 years old okay so this was a very important takeaway to solve this problem now her two brothers are two years and four years younger so younger means if we talk then 1 is nothing but 13 years so brother 1 i will put so brother 1 is 13 years and brother 2 is nothing but 15 minus 4 11 years okay so one brother is two years so 15 minus 2 is 13 another brother is 4 years younger so 15 minus 4 is 11 okay done and one brother is 2 years older so brother 3 i will put 15 plus 2 will be 17 okay right now i'm just collecting the data nothing else i'm doing okay now her sisters are four years five years and seven years older so sisters are for four years so 15 plus four sister one will be 19 sister two five years 20 and sister 3 it is 7 years so 15 plus 7 will be 22 years old okay now so they're asking the median of the age okay now so friends for calculating median that i will tell you in statistics as well so there is a video on statistics on our channel i will also put the link here so if you want to calculate median then first arrange them in ascending order so 11 13 15 17 19 20 and 21 so the for calculating median the first step will be arrange them in ascending order okay now after that you see the middle number so what is the middle number middle number is 17 so 17 will become the median age of all the siblings together so option d will be the correct answer for the question number two okay friends aptitude is easy if it is learnt and taught in the proper way okay so do not worry at all now question number three so question number three is again a compound interest problem and all the problems whatever we are doing today from the same shift okay from the same shift meaning is there were two problem from simple and compound interest okay so this is uh you can see here so simple interest as well as compound interest both are there in this problem mixture so mr raju lent out a certain sum on simple interest and the same amount and compound interest at a certain interest per annum so mr raju is there okay so he lent out so lent out means given the money to someone so principal so the money what he gave i assumed p okay rate of interest is not there certain rate of interest okay so rate of interest i will assume as r percentage okay now if the ratio between difference of compound interest first i am collecting the data so if the ratio between compound interest and simple interest for two years and three years and 3 years is equals to 10 by 31 okay right now i am collecting the data in the beginning i said if you collect the data 50 of the question is solved there itself okay is 10 is to 31 what is the rate of interest per annum okay now so there is formulizer so simple interest and compound interest difference for two years will be pr square divided by 100 square okay now and so for 3 years what will be the difference so 3s the difference will be p r square into 300 plus r divided by 100 q will be equal to 10 divided by 31 okay now so this is a formula for two year difference and three years difference okay now so what you can see p r square and p r square so it is a formula which you need to remember it okay divided by so this will divide this by 100 times because this is square and this is q so basically so this 100 will go up divided by 300 plus r will be equal to 10 by 31 right now so 1 0 1 0 cancel so cross multiplication 300 plus r will be equal to 310 so r will be equal to 10 so this is a very very simple problem if you know the formula then it will be very very easy for you to solve this is completely formula based so when you read this in exam you say sir i was not able to solve in 1.4 minute whatever the time was allocated for the particular question how you will be able to solve because you need to know before you go for the exam you need to be ready for that you need to have gone through all these questions then only it will be helping you and if you are solving previous year question then it will help you a lot okay no need to worry about that then the next problem here is the ratio problem okay so the next problem here is the ratio problem so the number of 10 pesa 20 pesa 25 pesa 50 peso coins contained in a bag so there is one bag is there so we have 10 peso 20 25 and 50 coins are there okay and in the ratio so in the ratio what one is to six one is to four one is to three one is to two okay and it's amount to rupees 240 now here it is per se here it is rupees there is something is has to be done okay now so rupees 240. so either rupees you convert to passe or passive you convert to rupees something has to be done the total value of 25 percent and 50 percent coin the total value of 25 peso and 50 peso coin is okay now so friends this problem you will be able to solve only when your basic is good friends i say if you are preparing for exams like tcs accenture in forces only work on your basics do not work on the difficult problem if any youtube channel is telling you or solving difficult difficult problem no if it is difficult means your basic is not good okay so let us work on the basics first suppose if we have 10 rupees one note okay so suppose 10 rupees note you have 5 20 rupees note you have 10 and 50 rupees note you have two so try to understand i'm going to very much basics so what is the total amount so 50 plus 200 250 and plus 100 it is 350 rupees okay so total amount is nothing but 350 okay fine so this is 5 is what number and this is what your amount okay now same thing we have to do here so 10 peso okay what is the number so it is given in terms of data see but so the number of 10 percent 20 25 percent 50 percent coin are contained in a bag are in the ratio of this that means these are the numbers one by six so friends if any data has been given to you in terms of ratio and if you want to convert it to in terms of value then just multiply by x okay so this is how we have to proceed it but what is the problem here so there are two problems are there okay so one is ratio is given in fraction so let us try to convert okay so i will note down the problems here and then we will solve one by one so first thing ratio is in fraction so let us convert this in the normal value this is very very simple okay so think of a value think of a value which is divisible by all four or you calculate the lcm of this value okay whatever you feel easy i could see 12 is a value which is divisible by all friends do not think this problem is tough i am telling you because i am teaching you from the basics so please try to understand so this is 2 3 4 and 6. so we got the ratio in the simple form okay not in fraction first problem done second problem is this is in passive passage cannot be equal to rupees rupees will only be equal to rupees five rupees plus two rupees will be seven rupees five peso plus two peso will not be seven rupees okay now so ten peso so ten peso okay we know hundred percent will be equal to one rupees so one passive will be equal to one by hundred rupees okay if we have ten peso my dear friends so it will be nothing but ten by hundred rupees simple so if you have ten per se so i will write here ten by hundred rupees okay that means one by 10 rupees so i will write here instead of 10 rupees we have 1 by 10 rupees and what is a number so if any data is given in terms of ratio if you want to write down in terms of value then you can multiply with a variable x you can refer my previous video of ratio and proportion everything is available on this youtube channel okay you just need to search and then you have to tackle uh the problem with okay now so 20 passes so 20 by 100 one by five rupees very simple okay into what is a number so now it is three so if you want to write down in terms of value so the number of twenty percent coin will become three x okay fine then the next will be 25 passes so 25 by 100 it will be one by four so it will be one by four rupees into what is a number so multiply with x and write 4x plus then 50 percent means half rupees so 1 by 2 rupees into what is the number the number will be 6x friend same thing we have done here 10 rupees okay and what is the number 5 in number so 50 20 rupees 10 in number so 200 rupees 50 into 200 rupees so total 350 rupees now total amount what they have given 240. see if you compare with the basic snow it will you will feel it very very simple okay now now what we will do so two 5's okay so x by 5 plus this is 3x by 5 plus 4 and 4 cancelled so x plus 2 3's are so it will be 3x will be equal to 240 now just take the lcm so lcm will be 5 5 1 1 so x 5 1 1 so 3 x 1 5 0 5 so 5 x and 1 5 5 5 3 will be 15 x will be equal to my difference 240 so 5 plus 15 20 and 20 plus 4 24 x by 5 will be equal to 240 so 24 will divide this by 10 times so x will be nothing but 50 i got x is equals to 50 now what is the question asked from you so the total value of 25 pesa and 50 peso coin okay so this is your 25 peso right so this is your 25 passes and this is nothing but your 50 okay so it is nothing but x plus 3 x so x plus 3 x right so 25 percent and 50 percent this is the total value that means the amount into the number so 4x the value of x is 50 so 4 into 50 will be 200 so 200 option c will be the correct answer so friends i am telling you again do this problem once again by yourself you will feel the problem is easy so in this particular problem i discussed the concept of ratio i discussed how to convert passing into rupees and i also discussed the basic concept how you will be able to handle this problem in the examination friends now what i'm doing in every video i'm trying to give one problem and i'm letting a student to solve this okay and then i am putting the solution in the uh you know the comment box and then i am pinning it okay so comment box and then i will pin it if your answer is correct then definitely you will get a heart from online study for you okay and thus those who are not able to solve so for that solution will be pinned okay after 24 hours or after 12 hours of at least uploading the video so that people get time to solve it okay so friends solve this question and if you really appreciate the video appreciate the effort you when we see the people are weaving it people are sharing it okay uh you are commenting then definitely we will be motivated to do more and more video see when we see the there is you know not much people engaging with the videos then we don't continue with that okay so if you really want us to continue with the tcs and qt uh august and november preparation then definitely uh please like share so that the views goes more more people will get benefited and we will be continue doing it okay so that is what we expect from you after spending so much of effort in making the videos making the ppt right and then presenting it in front of you right editing it all those things so it takes a lot of effort thank you friends

Transcript:
hi hello everyone welcome back to online study for you a complete placement solution so friends will have two different job openings which is applicable for the freshers with limited eligibility criteria there is no great technologies or trade coding knowledge to be not to get into this position so watch this video full to know about it and make registrations at the earliest okay so before that share this video with your friends so that they can also make use of the opportunities so first i'm starting with soho so the link to apply for all the jobs will be there in the description you can just pick it up from there and apply the earlier soon after you watch the video and first beginning with the zoho they are hiring for the technical support engineer so there are five qualities that they are looking forward for that is a proficiency in english attention to detail and a strong desire to learn ability to work independently and deliver value to the customer and the company should be willing to work in night shifts must be interested in accounting and finance side so basically they are not looking for word for a person who is very sound in programming languages or they should have these many technologies not there is no such criteria so this is applicable for most of all the graduates who are ready to take care of this night shifts and who are ready to take care of interaction with the customers and who's ready to i mean who's very good at communication everything very good in a sense not a great orator or uh not a good motivator but still was very good at interacting with people so all these five simple things you have to keep in mind when you go to soho so this is applicable for most of all of them everyone can try applying for this particular position okay so now this is about the eligibility criteria and you can just go to the job description as well so answering customer queries through phone email and chat is the thing that they're looking and keeping customers with basic troubleshooting configuration difficulties advancement technical issues in the product by working closely with the development team prompt communication of customer requirements to the team development and facilitate with product demos implementations and training okay so this is the basic things that you will be taking care of so as i've mentioned you don't must be a cse student alone you don't we must be uh like mechanical student alone anyone can apply clc mechanical auto whoever writers can apply if you have the basic knowledge in all these things there they've mentioned okay so now to apply for this you have to fill this form uh like your name everything if you don't have an experience and you can give it a zero your current and last company if you have worked i mean zero to one years of experience can even try it others or whoever having the experience you wherever you want so if you have worked past experience and everything again that provide that as well and if not then you can just leave that feed and after that you have to retouch your resume so resuming the sense you must update or customize your resume especially for soho with all these kind of points which they have pointed out like the five points from lgbt criteria this four points from description just pick up the keywords and apply else your character won't be getting selected okay so that's about it and you can submit your response so to this position the average ctc provided is 3.6 plus lpa for the freshers with zero years of experience so this is a very good position you can just try it and just know about the software development field how this company works and everything and from there you can just move on uh to the field that you love okay so this is about the soho so next thing we have another company so before that i would like to introduce something that we provide live coding classes for all exams you know without coding there is no job actually you must at least know some basic things some basic coding knowledge in whatever language like c c plus plus python java whatever it is so because we provide all of the languages here this class so you must know something primary things about that and only you will be able to get into some company which is i t sector so if you're not looking for an id sector it's fine but when you are trying to get into company coding knowledge is very important as it gets advanced your value will be getting out of mind so whoever batch it is whoever graduation type which is better to have according knowledge so that you can go with us so 15th july we are planning to start our next session of live coding classes seven to eight is the time duration from monday to friday so you can just

paper freshly prepared question papers everything okay so again just try it applying to this so this is added by samia maps to apply you can go with the link which i have mentioned in the description box okay so that's about the courses that we are offered and next we have another job opening from canada so they are heading for the junior data analyst and the location is hyderabad so coming to the details regarding that skills required that is selectivity criteria questionnaire analyzing programming profession data processing tools and packages data reformatting merging customized data reports and other outputs data validation spss labeling customized data reports and tables generation written in verbal english communication interpersonal skills like worker tech self-confidence listening relationship management and collaboration quick learning adaptability no survey platforms and tools so what they're looking forward is you are an analyst basically jury analyst so they don't want you to have some basic programming knowledge some uh an analyst you are unless so you must have one blessing knowledge and you must be good at written verbal english communication and some of the interpersonal skills like you must be having like that you must be a good team player what they take self-confidence listening all these things must be so both of the jobs that i've presented today is not applicable for one criteria alone they don't want you to have so much of the programming language so much of the technical knowledge but the basic thing if you are having you can go well with that and if you lack so much of your basic knowledge we can provide you with the life orders which i have uh mentioned just few seconds before live coding classes and if you don't want uh inconvenient for you like for the live classes then you will be we have some pre-recorded classes as well in the application you can just go with that as well or not only not if you wish to get guidance from anything anywhere you can just go learn it and apply for all these companies okay so to apply for that you can just go with this apply button and coming to the lgbt criteria 2019 plus patches can have take part in this can apply here and uh it is applicable for any graduate as well and coming to uh 2020 first batch 2020 first batch who have passed out okay some of them will be doing the final semester now so they uh you can just try applying and also 2020 first passed out badges can definitely apply and in within this month or within next month 2020 first patches will be passing out then you can apply but it takes a too long time to apply for that you just uh have to make clear in the first interview session itself that uh i am not passed out yet because most of them will be looking forward for immediate joining so you must not uh miss that opportunity okay so it is very important to go with that so you can apply it and 2022 this is not applicable for you they are looking forward for till 2020 first matches okay so this is the application form you can just attach your resume and go with that and you will be having a form to fill your personal details that also you can give it and you can provide this up i uploaded one of uh the random resumes and this is how it looks your some of the regions will autofill so we can give all these kind of details you can just fill it and go for the next next you will be having some place for adding your skills and if your experience that as well some experience details and if you're refresher you can go for that as well and after that you can submit okay so this is the basic filling format that you have to take care of when you apply for this particular opening as a junior data analyst uh so i think this is very clear so coming to the package it is to this opening also they do provide 3.8 plus lpas uh for the thresholds okay so now if you find both of this job then you can definitely apply to my part i would suggest you to apply for this because both of these job openings doesn't have a great lgbt criteria to go it's very basic so anyone can apply it for right now okay so if you have any further doubts please do let me know in the comment sections and sessions regarding the video content also well welcomed in the comment section we are going through all of your comments and working on it okay so that's all for today if you have anything to go just make it in the comment section so until i come up with another video regarding so much of opportunities available across everybody stay safe stay happy and stay tuned to online study for you

Kpit 19-23 k fresher ko select ki .un fresher ko january 2023 ko traing me bulayee. Unme kuch fresher ko nikal di. Kuch ne khud chhor diya. Aur jo abhi hai unko abhi tk full time nhi kiya hai. 11 month se ve traing kr rhe hai.Kuchh ko kpit ne january me kuchh ko july me and kuchh ko october me bulayee hai trainig ke liye.kya yah baat sahi hai.  Kpit aisa kyo kr rahi hai.
It's quite lengthy process, earlier there was only two test & one interview.
iam recently write my exam which day iam receive my next round any one pls respond to my msg frnds
im from electronics engineering kpit is asking to choose one among three and all branches are eligible here including mech,civil, biotechnology,chemical, Industrial 
cz its on campus

so as a electronics student which option will be better to get an edge over others.
plss reply
1. embedded and C
2.oops in c++
3.model based design
Kpit is the worst company to work for it doesn't care about it's employees. All it cares about is gaining profit at the cost of making employees working for 14 hrs a day without any increment in salary.
This company doesn't have any good project that matches the competency of its employees you'll end up working in a stupid annotation or pre labeling project. Their management too is very poor and unfriendly all they care about is meeting the target without considering how much the subordinates are working.
At last you'll end up in a lot of disappointment.
Don't join the company even it they give you open offer.
If anyone give 2nd round in C language, there will be only MCQ or coding question also will be there or not?
Scripted nicely 🤣👌
Is there any interview round
Is it work from home or work from office for her ???
If we want to go to software side after completing 2 years in KPIT will we be considered as fresher or experienced?
Is kpit a complete ece core job?
Could you please tell me how to prepare for second round
Hii, I have a doubt regarding I didn't get any mail for second round assessment test,after completing first round I'm waiting for second round results ( shortlisted/rejected) but nothing have came what should I do now,how should I contact them,will the mail come or not? I'm in confusion,please ask experts and clear this doubt! tq
Is kpit results depend on section wise or overall marks ??
Can anyone tell me the role in kpit for 3.60 lpa????....
Current status : application in progress 
What can I understand with this, I was completed exam 2 weeks back
I knew her  she is my friend 💟

Di i have a question like on which platform we should try practice coding for tcs divital
Thank you so much for uploading this video really  I  needed this one
n=int(input())
l=[1,2,4]
if n==0:
    print(1)
elif n==1:
    print(2)
elif n==2:
    print(4)
else:
    for i in range(3,n+1,1):
        l.append(l[i-1]+l[i-2]+l[i-3])

    print(l[-1])
Is this correct for the second ans please give me reply
I want to join this course
I think you did it WRONG
@OnlineStudy4U
pls provide the answer to 2nd question
What topics of Python coding are to be studied to attempt TCS digital coding round
Im 2022 passed out...can I appear now for free aug 2021 TCS NQT?
#python

train=int(input())
list=[]
for i in range(train):
    list.append(int(input()))
    list.append(int(input()))
coun=[]    
for i in list:
    
    counting=list.count(i)
    coun.append(counting)
     
coun.sort()
print(coun[-1],"platforms required")
Will tcs recruit 2021 batch for digital profile in august
Kuch samaj nahi aya kya train kon si train ,kaha gayi pata nahi 😂😂😂
Will tcs hire 2021 passouts for the ninja profile through the August NQT?
TCS Codevita 2021 dates are released or not ?


=== TCS Digital Aptitude Questions Asked on 3rd October 2020 | TCS Digital PYQ ===

Transcript:
hello everyone and i welcome all of you to online study for you a complete placement solution friends in our today's video i am going to solve tcs digital exact question which was asked on 3rd of october 2020 that means last year so 2020 the tcs digital question i am going to solve it here i am going to discuss it here this questions even you can find it on the google also friends many youtube channel i have seen they will be only doing the difficult problem what was asked in tcs digital and they will demotivate right they will demotivate the student or they will just take out the confidence from them okay so friends it should not be like that whatever questions were asked we should discuss each and every level of the question generally students will be clear okay so these are the level if you prepare of you know this level then you will be easily able to clear the examination so i will be discussing with you today few questions which will have the mixed level of the question which was asked on tcs a digital exam third of october okay so question number two question number three question number four okay and in between i will also tell you when the examination will happen how it is planned how you will be able to crack tcs digital examination so friends question number one was asked from the topic simplification okay so if you are aware of cube roots if you are aware of square root and if you are aware of certain indices then you will be easily able to solve this question this question is very very easy see you need to get your confidence back friends okay so the previous year questions uh solving that will definitely give you confidence now so cube root of 27 will be what three okay so here we have also uh you know used bode mask so board mask means first we need to take care of the brackets so you can see this is a bracket so first we will solve the content inside the bracket so cube root of 27 will be nothing but 3 because 3 cube is what 27 into 16 square so 16 square i will not multiply i will write 16 into 16 okay and then 2 cube will be nothing but 8 so if i will try to solve this okay so if i try to solve this then first we need to take care of the division right so 16 divided by 8 will be nothing but 2 so 48 into 2 will be 96 so this particular portion we have got 96 okay now let us go inside this particular bracket so a square root of 289 will be nothing but square root of 289 will be nothing but 17 2 a square will be 4 and minus of 4 and whole to the power square root is there so 68 minus 4 is 64 to the power 1 by 2 this is nothing but 8 and here division sign was there so we will put it division okay so this is this complete bracket we have got it okay so this particular part we have got it here okay now next division so this particular one we will solve 12 square will be 144 and divided by eight 180 will be nothing but my dear friends so a teenager will be 144 okay so tables your searcher indices square root and cube root is what is given here then okay after that again we have one more bracket now so friends 243 to the power 1 by 5 okay see if it is 1 if it is 2 we can easily solve it but if it is 5 then it is difficult for us to solve okay see this 5 somehow we need to remove it so this 243 we will try to uh divide okay we will try to factorize basically so three ajah and three one ja okay then three 27 times then three nine times and then you can see again three three times and again three one times right okay so here i could see this is nothing but 3 to the power 5 okay so 243 is nothing but 3 to the power 5 and to the power 1 by 5 so 3 to the power 5 into 1 by 5 so this will become 3 plus 128 so 128 if we also factorize similarly then it will be nothing but 2 to the power 7 so this will be nothing but 2 to the power 7 to the power 1 by 7 okay so it will factorize in the similar way so this will become nothing but 2 okay friends i could have directly written this but i wanted to tell you how basically we do i don't want to snatch the confidence from you i want to build the confidence into you that is what is online study for you motor now so if you divide 96 by 8 it will be 12 okay then divided by okay then here 8 divided by 3 plus 2 will be 5 and 5 minus 1 will be 4 so 12 divided by 8 divided by 4 will be what 2 so 12 by 2 will be 6 so option c friends in tcs digital for one question you will be getting almost three minutes so you will have 15 questions okay you'll have 15 questions and you will be getting 40 minutes to solve from aptitude okay so 15 questions you will be getting in tcs digital from aptitude and you will be getting almost 40 minutes to solve that means for one question almost three minutes so the time will be sufficient the question level will be also very very easy because i have discussed all the basic here so it might have taken some time okay but this question is not that lengthy okay now so friends if you want me to continue the series of tcs digital previous year coding questions aptitude questions and english question then please do comment because whatever we are doing we are doing for you guys so if you guys are really watching appreciating it comment like and if you are new to our channel please do subscribe and then only we will be able to bring out more and more content for you friends as you know the exam has been planned in the first week of august okay like uh last year and we have got this information from uh you know the tpos so basically this will happen in premium colleges and we have got this information from any training and placement departments of the premium colleges okay now if you're from premium colleges and if you have not got any kind of notification then you can check with your tpo right okay if you are from non-premium colleges friends then the only option with you is so you write the tcs nqt exam which is going to happen in august and november okay and if you become the topper in that then you will be able to write the tcs digital exam or the other option is code beta so that is also planned uh in the month of august but there is no uh notification as of now so friends we will inform you as soon as we get any kind of information so please uh you know subscribe our youtube channel and click all click on uh bell icon so that you get all the notification okay so whatever is the right information that only we will give it to you so we won't give you some information which is not relevant okay now question number two so what is the average of all natural number between 31 to 50 so natural number means 31 32 33 34 okay and then here till 50. so friends i had seen many students what they did so they told sir this is in arithmetic progression and then they started sir a is equals to 31 even many channels have also done friends and common difference is one and then the last term is nothing but 50 and they started using n by 2 into 2 a plus n minus 1 into these formulas and all it is very simple not even one line answer okay so i used to tell and even if you'll see the youtube channel average topic i have told multiple times so if we have to calculate average of if we have to calculate average of continuous number if we have to calculate average of continuous number or number having same difference or numbers having same difference okay numbers having same difference then your average will be equal to first number plus last number divided by 2 that's all so my first number here is 31 and my last number is nothing but 50 divided by 2 so this will be 81 by 2 that means 40 into 2 will be 80.5 so 40.5 so this was a fill in the blanks question which was asked in the your tcs digital exam and that question you can see friends how easy this is this will not even take one minute and they have given you three minutes for this question okay so this question also you have to show right that this was asked in tcs digital october 13. you put this question on google google itself will tell you that my dear friends this question was asked on third of october tcs digital examination and this is third of october 2020 okay so do not mistake that it is some three four years back questions no last year only it was asked now question number three so question number three friends also it will hardly take 30 seconds to solve this okay see i'm telling you put the question on the google okay do not blame later okay so see this will give you the confidence that you can also do any one can do right okay so what is the sum of roots of x from the following equation so you have equation quadratic equation 12 x square minus 23x plus 5 is equals to 0 they are asking what is the sum of roots of x okay so sum of roots so sum of roots will be nothing but minus b by a your quadratic equation will be always in the form of ax square plus bx plus c will be equal to zero okay so friends last year there were two three questions where quadratic equation was required and the questions were directly asked from quadratic equation so quadratic equation is one of the very important topic if you want me to do the quadratic equation using the tricks that also you please put in the comments so that i will be able to help you out with that okay i will make a video on that okay so minus b so this is a x square plus b x plus c is equals to zero now my b will be nothing but minus 23 okay and divided by a a is nothing but 12. so the sum of roots will be 23 by 12 that means option a will become the correct answer for the question number three okay now friends we have a very good question from you know the question number four from you can say time and work which even needs arithmetic progression to solve it and these questions will take almost three minutes right to solve this so this question i am agree with you so this will take time okay now so let us see one by one this also involves concept so 60 men undertook an assignment to complete it in a certain number of days so suppose 60 men undertook to complete this work in x days okay so if i will talk about the total number of main then it will be nothing but 60 x see suppose 60 main is there and you are completing the work in 10 days so 16 to 10 will become what 600 right so if you have 600 main they will be able to complete the work in one day okay now and if i will talk about okay the total main then this is nothing but 60 x okay fine so but second day onwards two men started to leave the work every day and the assignment took four extra days to complete please try to understand so earlier the total main required was nothing but 60 x okay now what happened the first day 60 men worked okay and after that two men started leaving every day so next day 58 see understanding the question is very very important then 56 then 54 and it will be keep going like this and because of that they are taking x plus four days so earlier they were taking x days okay why because 60 men were working right but now every day two two main will start leaving so for today 60 then next day 58 okay earlier 60 60 60 every day so definitely they will be taking now more number of days okay now friends if you see this is nothing but given in uh you know this is nothing but arithmetic progression right the first term is what the first term is 60 okay and then you can see second term is 58 so there is a gap of 2 so i can say the first term is 60 first term is 60 and then the common difference is minus 2 so you can see there is a difference of minus 2 between the numbers okay now if you will talk about n so the total number of terms that means they are working for x plus 4 days so it will become nothing but x plus 4 okay fine so friends we also know in arithmetic progression sum will be equal to what so sum of n number will be n by 2 into 2 a plus n minus 1 into d okay now sum is what so sum is nothing but 60x that we are clear okay in total number of terms x plus 4 divided by 2 into 2a so 2 into 60 plus n n will be what friends so n you know right n is what x plus 4 right see whatever i am doing it is in front of you only so x plus 4 minus 1 into it will be minus 2 agreed so n is nothing but x plus 4 minus 1 into minus okay now so if i multiply 2 here but 2 you keep so what will be the advantage i will take some other color okay so 2 will divide this 2 i mean if you take 2 common then it will get divided by 2 right so now let my video be here ok because this is little lengthy so yes now i will use all the space so 60x will be equal to x plus 4 okay into here it will become 60 plus this will become so this plus will become minus because here we have minus okay 60 minus um okay and x plus 3 okay now 60 x will become equal to x plus 4 and here 60 minus x minus 3 so 60 x will be equal to x plus 4 step by step i am doing so that you will not have any kind of confusion so minus x and 63 if it will get subtracted it will become 57 okay so it will become 57 okay now friends now what we will do so 60x will be equal to now multiplication so minus x square and 50 plus 57 x minus four x and 57 into four so 57 into four four seven zero twenty uh eight and 228 it will become okay then so this will become minus x square okay so you can see we have 57 right x so 57 minus 4 will be what 53 x okay so minus x square plus 53 x plus 228 will be 60 x now 60 x we will bring it here so minus x square and this will be minus 7x plus 228 is equals to zero now minus and i will send it that side so 7x minus 228 will be equal to 0. if you'll solve this you will be getting the value of x is goes to 12 okay so x is 2 x goes to 12 you will be getting the value so when i will do the quadratic equation i will tell you how you will be getting the value of x is goes to 12 okay now so let us bring it here ok now so what they they're asking so friends actually how much time they would have taken so they would have taken 60 into 12 okay so you can say 720 okay see 60 main if suppose if you have 10 men okay and working for 10 days okay so efficiency in two days will be nothing but work so basically total work was nothing but they would have total completed 720 work they would have completed total 720 work okay so total work is 720 they would have completed 721 but now the question is if the same assignment is given to 30 main so now 30 men is going to complete this work okay with only three by five efficient as previous man so earlier the previous man efficiency was one okay sixty into one so sixty main each main efficiency is one and they took 12 days so basically total total 720 was the work but now the efficiency has been reduced it has become three by five so one three by five is nothing but three by five now so this will become 324 times 240 okay so 240 into 5 divided by 3 okay so i'm sorry this is 40 times because 1 0 1 0 will get cancelled and 3 8 ja and 8 into 4 will be 40. so now if the same work 30 main with three by five if you cnc if they will do then they will be completing this work in 40 days so this was a good question which involves arithmetic progression which involves quadratic equation which involves time and work question so i will definitely say this is actually a tcs digital question and friends we have solved four questions in this so all level questions has been covered here easy moderate and difficult this is how your question paper will come so if some channels or if somebody is doing only difficult problem that is only to demotivate you okay this is only to break down your confidence okay so friends uh stay with us we will be doing all the previous year problems of tcs digital so that you get more and more idea and all these are actual question exact question you can also uh check it on google so if you have not subscribed to our channel please do subscribe and click on bell icon and in fact our tcs digital courses are also launched so you can check that course definitely things are going to help you so friends thanks a lot for watching the video

I am not able to understand the solution of last example.
sir please continue
Yes sir,, please doo
Please continue. It's very helpful sir!!

hi guys welcome back to online study for you a complete placement solution so today we have uh one job opening from by juice to go which is an associate position so let's see what are the eligibility criteria like how to the process for the application and everything in detail format so before that there are two things that i would like to make a reminder from our part that is whenever you apply for a job the first important thing that you should always notice make sure that you meet the eligibility criteria of that opposition okay until you may then uh you won't be getting up your application will be getting selected first thing and second thing is you have a good resume with you they assume in the sense all the keywords from job description and all the keywords from eligibility criteria is well defined it will resume me and which is appealing and what you say which just make click your candidature okay so make sure that you have two of the things together when you apply for any of the job so that's all about the thing make sure that this is always there in your mind okay so now moving on to the opening which is an associate position in by juice so coming to the details regarding that so coming to the job description the first actually they are looking for a tea person like who is ready to contribute to the team and who is ready to guide the students and give the necessary mentorship for the students i mean who are the customers of the badgers okay so it's something like interacting with the people like conveying the message and motive of the vice jews to the normal people okay so you must be capable of these many things which i am going to present in the lgbt criteria and make sure that everything is well certainly in you to apply for this position so now coming to the alibaba criteria excellent communication skills uh should apply only if interested in target-based sales must be a graduate diploma not allowed at candidates pursuing education are not allowed shouldn't have interviewed at buy juice in last 90 days that is firstly first thing is they want excellent communication skill they don't uh like they don't want you to have some sort of graduation like this graduates only that graduates only be tech only mca only mba only there is no criteria like that if you are any graduate it's completely fine and also if you're any batch also it's completely fine until you are a graduating student you must be a graduate like you must be graduated okay in the sense uh some of the students from 2020 first passing out patch would have passed out or some of them still in the final semester so those who are still there for me final semesters cannot apply to this position but who have passed out can apply so like uh telling in a closed format it's something applicable for 2020 till 20th the bad students okay and also one more thing that i've mentioned in the lgbt criteria is regarding the target based things there will be target this is not commonly worth my juice a lot it's common with any kind of corporate job you'll be having some sort of target to go so if you're ready to take those things and do accordingly then you can go over this position okay and also diploma is not uh accepted here you must be a graduate and one more criterias should not have interviewed at by juice in last 90 days so you should not uh been applied for any kind of interviews for the last 90 days and if you have then wait next time you just try after this completion of 90 days you keep on trying so you'll be getting some time you'll be getting it okay so coming to the location details it's pan india that is across india and requirements is interested in mentoring and guiding students and knack of sales good interpersonal and presentation skills so as i've mentioned the customers of yours will be obviously the students so uh you must be able to motivate them you must be able to mentor them like contact with them like have a communication with them is what you are actually doing here it's like promoting the motives or promoting the business related ideas of buy juice to the normal customers so you must be good at that and having a knack of sales obviously something lot of sales like promoting your companies what you're doing in a business field obviously all the fields of a business is related to that one way or the other you are promoting uh your company so if you are good at that you can go with that and good interpersonal and presentation skill obviously yes and yes uh skills will be good communication skills active listening skills like somebody's customers are speaking to you and you feel like okay just stop them and you taking the advantage and talking is not good at all you must communicate well and you must be good listeners as well and uh strong convincing skills client handling skills ability to handle stress and rejection in solidizing clients okay in the sense you must be a good convey uh communicator you must be a good listener and you must be uh like good at convincing thing like communicating the ideas of the company and the salary package is uh five lakhs to 10 lakhs per annum is the package so basically you will be having a fixed package and between this five to ten lakhs and you'll be getting incentives based on the target that you achieved or based on the performance that you had and now coming to the working days like you have to work five days a week and two days consecutively you will be getting off okay in the sense saturday sunday is not a fixed holiday for you like it can be monday tuesday it can be tuesday when i say whatever so this is about uh the details regarding the application and if this is okay in you and if you are ready to go with this is the right option because by juice pays their employees well and obviously in this business development department it will definitely accelerate your career okay so this is the things that you have to keep in mind and coming to the application process how to apply for that so you can go with the link which i've mentioned in the description box and download the able jobs application and you can just go like that search like buy juice and uh get the business associate position and apply for that okay and you will be having a form to fill your details and to give your resume so as i've mentioned make sure that your resume contains the keywords from lgbt criteria so it will be helpful uh in making your candidature get selected okay that's how resumers are getting selected until then giving so much of unwanted things and making rich you're resuming doesn't help only things which is related to the eligibility criteria is required in your resume so make sure that you do it okay so these are the things that you should keep in mind while you apply for buy juice and i think it's very clear so apply at the earliest and wait for the call and interview attend the interview fruitfully and just get placed in your dream company okay so if you have any further doubts regarding this please do let us know in the comment section and also solutions regarding the video content also well welcomed in the comment section so that's all for today until i come up with another video regarding so much of opportunities available across everybody stay happy stay safe and stay tuned to online study for you

Hello EveryOne, You can write November Exam without writing August Exam. But Please We request you to write August Exam first, so if you get less marks or if your exam goes bad, you will have a opportunity to write November Exam. So think that August exam is mandatory and prepare accordingly.

=== TCS NQT 2021| How to Prepare?| Exam Pattern, Syllabus? | Cut OFF Score | Important Topics ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=ei37QwYMGuc

Transcript:
hi guys welcome back to online study for you a computational solution so friends in this video we are going to discuss what is the exam pattern of thesis and QT which is scheduled on August and November so August examination is just one month ahead so it is high time that we should know about it and start preparing right now because if it's furthermore late will not be getting immense time for the revision and all kind of things so in this we'll be discussing the pattern examination pattern and what all the things that you should keep in mind if you're going for self study or if you wish to get a assistance whatever it is how are we study but what are the things that you should keep in mind and uh the topics which you should cover and the reasoning attitude coding and subject in QT industry and QT psychometry everything okay all these variants what are the topics that you should cover so watch this video full to know about it and start your preparation right now don't delay further okay so moving on to the first topic which is disease and Beauty examination pattern okay so here as you can see the subject is of all the different criterias like verbal reasoning numerical program logic and code so here you can see this cognitive skills is the first part so these cognitive skills has these little things to go like verbal reasoning and numerical so these three portions constitute the cognitive and you know to get you should get approximately 80 percentage of marks in this cognitive then only you will be getting passed to this okay you will be having that cutoff score so it is very important to mine this cognitive part so here you can see for verbal ability 24 questions 30 minutes duration reasoning ability 30 questions and 50 minutes numerical ability 26 questions and 40 minutes and uh programming logic is 10 questions and 15 minutes Cody questions to questions and 45 minutes so so this is a subject uh these but this programming logic and coding session constitute subject and QT industry and QT and coding things basic programming skills everything till this these three portions are called cognitive skills okay so total you have to attend 92 uh yes 92 questions but 180 minutes within 180 minutes is a Time duration available so this is the examination pattern that you will be facing when you get into this examination so what are the important things that you keep in mind while start your starting your preparation so first thing is you should always keep in mind the speed of your things execute I mean solve a question like one to one point four minutes only you'll be getting uh like time to solve a single question and some of the topics will be that easy that you may be able to uh solve it within seconds so you will be getting that time to this question which is a little more trickier so you'll get to relax and do that question so time management is very important so just keep in mind like one minute one point four uh like one minute is the best thing to do only you'll be getting the question uh solving time for the question so you have to try solving that time management is very important and next is shortcuts for solving is some must without knowing the shortcuts things you cannot uh take part all these kind of questions you can see how there are numerous questions to put 24 questions with 30 minutes only 30 questions are there for 15 minutes only 26 questions for 40 minutes only so it takes time so you should have to know the shorthand tricks to solve all that questions if then you will be able to attend all of the questions okay now the third thing is the option exclusion technique actually this is the brightest thing and this is one of the not shortcuts this is actually a Lifeline that you can ever get that is uh like you'll be having four to five options to go so so some of the options will be like it is not actually related to the topic or related to the question itself so you can just exclude the questions and remaining you will be getting one or two or three like probably two options to go so within that you can just find your answer quickly so you don't know if you even if you don't know the perfect answer can just compute okay these two options will not come for this question so just leave that and these are the two options left so this option the single option is looks much closer to the answer like it is much closer to the question so this may be the answer so we can just predict like that and uh get predict the right answer like predicting the forcing is not the right thing but predicting the right action and how can you make to conclusion that how to do that and if you just practice all those things and you'll get to know that the structure of options and how to select among that and all these kind of things okay now we have the other which is a structure of repeated questions that it easiest is obviously a moderate client of x uh going on it's obviously easy to moderate uh question papers they used to have so they have some structure which is repeated some patterns of questions which is repeated in every time so we have to identify that if you got there then like one by fourth of your examination is done if you got this structure repeated like uh repeated question structure if you got with that then completely done all these one by four of the questions were done and next we have the frequency of questions as I've mentioned it is easy to moderate but in every topic some topics may be seems easy for us other topics may be some difficult so all these topics how this moderate like these is the range of questions that is coming so there's frequency of question is very important to know so know about that so if you could keep this Five Points in mind and if you could follow these Five Points then half of your online assessment is completely done remaining only yeah like in the sense hundred percentage 50 is completely done remaining out of 80 to get the uh score only uh 30 percentage left 20. okay so that is the studying that you have to contribute okay so let's see what are the things that you should keep in mind so first is the aptitude aptitude is the inevitable portion in any of the online assessment not only with the TCS but with everything so there are approximately 25 plus topics coming under aptitude but here it is the most frequent it is not easy to study all those topics and within this month and apply right so here we have some uh like important topics that you should never omit so these are the topics uh you can say simplification like you will be simplifying a large number to the smallest and uh choosing the right one and average percentage ratio and proportion ages profit loss status statistics time and work time speed and distance permutation combination and probability quadratic equation number system hcf and LCM clocks and calendar mixture and allegation so these are the topics that you should keep in mind so just every all of this topic have a simple short hair tricks or simple equation to go equation is in simple formula which is very simple like monster formula to go so if you got introduced with one step formula then just try solving like three to four questions before attending the examination as a revision part okay just try to solve three to four questions which is a frequently occurring question in TCS and under these all these topics then you are completely turned to face the examination okay so this is about the attitude section and next we have the reason reasoning is very very important because reasoning is actually most important will come by to the other and uh you know you can score high in this section so you may not be good at calculation everything so if you put high like you know highly score this section then if you have some little drawbacks or little less Mark in the other section the mark that is covered in this section will compensate that okay and reasoning is a funny way of studying like you have to go for this blood relation so this is the mother of that that is a brother of this and who is this to them so all these kind of questions when you solve it you feel so funny way to study and you'll feel motivated to study so all these topics that you should uh should not ever omade you should learn this completely okay so the reasoning topics are blood relation Direction numbers uh series puzzles that is hating Arrangement syllogism figural and factual analysis decision making alphabetical series coding decoding critical reasoning okay so don't ever omit the reasoning part you know first you take care of this reasoning part very well well complete it and then go for the third part okay attitudinal reasoning is very important just go for it okay now as I mentioned we have so much of important things to go like uh these important points that you have to do so these things are to be mastered only if this is in your hand then everything will fall apart in your hands all right so if you want your guidance we have an attitude and reasoning crash course session which is going to start on 5th of July from 8 PM onwards Monday to Friday classes will be there Handle by protects are your favorite uh aptitude master so here you can see it's a live online class so the recordings will be available to you class recordings the materials will be available and you will be getting the life doubt clearing sessions extra drought reading sessions individual attention will be called to you and you know previous entity questions mocked US based on that and previous entity questions everything is available okay and shorthand tricks everything will be taught to you so not only based upon Jesus and QT it will be applicable for all the competitive examination like Infosys web Pro Accenture cognizant whatever it is whatever it is okay but since TCS is going to make disease in QT is to be done on this August some papers some uh like you know exclusive questions regarding that repeated questions which is a sure questions will be available also okay so all these package you can get it by just rupees making registration of 249 so you can go with the link with which I've mentioned in the description so coming to this you may don't feel like this is a great amount actually this is you know all these things you're getting under this package okay so you can go with the link which I mentioned in the description or you can go with the number which I've given here eight zero double eight four five two seven six zero okay so if you wish to get the guidance make it the earliest don't delay because opportunities never knocks it right twice now next topic is the verbal ability it is based upon the knowledge that you are having in English communication okay so here you can see synonyms and antonyms is one of the topic and spotting the error either detection sentence Improvement sentence reordering closed test spelling mistake and change of voices so these are some of the topics that you have to care care of verbal ability so most of them will be like okay verbal ability is not much good in that but you just try improving in at least the era detection spotting the era sentence Improvement sentence reordering spelling mistake things so all of because synonyms and antonyms things are very important but you know sometimes we it will not be no hands we may not be get to answer all these kind there are so much words in English and there are so much synonyms for a single word right so we're not beginning to do that but don't worry keep everything ready the other parts ready and also if you could have a good score with aptitude reasoning uh sessions then verbal ability if you've gone let it down then that will compensate but not too down okay you just have to go only just some little compromise to go okay so just make sure that all these topics are in your hands now now we have the other topic which is psychometrics test so if you have selected a variant or psychometry test and you have we'll be focusing these things one not five questions are there in total and 68 questions from behavioral and 45 questions from motivational part so actually in this as I've mentioned in variant selection itself psychometric test is something like assessing your capability assessing your culture whether that your culture is adaptable to the company culture you will be a good candidate there like your soft skill is good how your soft kiss is important so that is assistant psychometrics so you can see these are the four example questions are you a team player so in the sense they will be asking some questions like uh some things happen like this in your team so how will you just go with that uh like yeah will you react like this so very true to me somewhat and true to me very true and true to me with these questions you will be answering and with that you will be assessing you how candidate you are regarding the soft skill now will you be able to handle deadlines like it is not important uh obviously most of the time we will not be able to handle deadlines right so sometimes you'll be handing them but sometimes we miss them so when we miss how we are handling that that is important right so all these things are analyzed there and how good you are at organizing things how do you see the success of August are you a person like egotic or you take the inspiration by other success you take that an inspiration for your life all these things are necessed here okay so this is about the psychometric test and next we have the industrial Duty that is if you have selected industry and cubic sessions then you will be having some questions related with the it sector the basic knowledge on industry that is basic knowledge on I.T sector so have given two questions here full form of FTP that is file transfer crypto code and when did it act came into effective 2002 so this is basically like a random questions or basic knowledge on it sector so if you have those kind of things if you have opted for this you have to keep these kind of things in your mind okay so this is about industry iqt so it is a must think that you have to go for that like 28 25 questions approximately you will be getting under this normally okay now next we have subject inequity this subject in QT is actually a rough planning of all the fundamentals of computer science okay it is data structures basis of operating system fundamentals of computer memory hierarchy software development life cycle so data structures and software development life cycle is two important topics which is a must here doesn't mean that the other topic is but you should not skip this at any cost okay Basics only nothing deep into it all the basic things that you have to know here so subject Equity you have to do okay and uh see recently somewhere mama has started a data structure series Live class Series so if you have any further thoughts you can go to the video session or YouTube playlist and get that done if you want to have some data structure basic knowledge in it okay so this is about the subject including next we have the basic programming skills if you belong to likes non-cs Department it is very important to has the basic knowledge of the programming things so Ms shortcut keys like control plus C is for copy Control Plus X is for cut all these kind of simple shortcut keys examples that you must know when you like when you operate your computer then you will get to know right so these kind of things and fundamentals of programming is very important like data structures all these kind of things okay data types what are the data types and see those kind of simple things and functions and scope that is what to call it a function and what are the Scopes available like Global private those kind of and call by value and reference these is the important topic out there and alterations and decorations the difference between that examples on that and finding the output finding the output in the sense not um very difficult questions some simple questions on finding the output sections okay now next is the coding if you select the coding part if you are have gone through that then you'll be having a suspension you'll be having two questions to go under coding here you can see you would be having two questions to go under query for 45 minutes it's optional like if you have selected the coding part then you will be getting inspired you have selected subject subject or in QT you will be attending the C so when you select the coding you have these many coding language to go C C plus plus Java Pearl and python it is completely optional so you can select your own coding language and start it like if you have not started yet you know nothing just don't worry pick a simple language from this sessions section and just start practicing that coding language and that appear for the examination so if you just ask me which is the best suggestions to go you can go for python python is obviously simple so you can go for that you just start learning one of the coding language and and try to enter the question obviously regressions will not be that difficult it will be moderate okay TCS and QT is always a kind of moderate questions okay so this is about the syllabus that you have to cover when you prepare for thesis in Duty okay so in this video we have completely discussed regarding the topics and what are the instructions that you have to keep in mind these kind of instructions that you have to keep in mind regarding the preparation okay so don't miss this just watch this video again and again and know about the things and prepared accordingly because if you apply for this time then next time you will not be able to get an opportunity to apply for thesis and QT again so you are missing for the chance and also we are making a payment to like we are making a payment to intuity team to uh appear for this examination right so we should make use of that at right time so we have one month ahead if you take if you could spend like one uh two hours a day then you can easily crack this examination and if you wish to get our guidance well welcome you can go with our courses available and there are exclusive courses under our application for these is a node so that also you can make it at your convenience you can go with the link and explore our application and start learning it with us okay and if you want to get some free materials you can go over the YouTube sessions YouTube video session they have posted an immense free materials today okay so I think it's very clear if you have any further doubts regarding uh all these things which I've discussed in this video and if you want any other topics to be known uh widely or if you wish to know some of the things how to do that how to do this if you have such kind of concerns then you can definitely make it in the comment section of this video and we will look into that and we'll present you a Content regarding that as well okay so that's all for today everybody start learning now itself everybody stay safe stay happy and stay tuned to online study for you

कि अ हुआ है कि नमस्कार दोस्तों मैं हूं आपका दोस्त इस पर स्वागत करता हूं आपको इस वीडियो में जहां पर हम डिस्कस कर रहे हैं एप्टिट्यूड सीरीज का वन आफ थे मोस्ट इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक टाइम एंड वर्क दोस्तों इस टॉपिक को हम तो मोस्ट इंपॉर्टेंट टॉपिक्स क्यों मानता है एटीट्यूड में व्यक्ति किसी भी मेजर आईटी कंपनीज की बात कर लीजिए ईवन आप किसी भी कोंपेटीटिव एग्जाम की बात कर लीजिए उसके एप्टिट्यूड के सिलेबस में आपको टाइम एंड वर्क डेफिनेटली मिलने वाला है दोस्तों उसके अलावा आप गेट एक्जाम ले लीजिए के एग्जाम ले लीजिए जीवन किसी भी कैंपस प्लेसमेंट के एग्जाम लीजिए तो इस बांध मोस्ट स्टॉप एक है मतलब बहुत ज्यादा पूछा जाने वाला टॉपिक दोस्तों और स्टूडेंट पर्सनली इस टॉपिक को डिफिकल्ट फील करते हैं बट मैं बहुत आसान वह कंफर्टेबल फील करते थे टॉपिक हुए दूसरी यहां पर हम कोशिश करेंगे कि हम किस तरीके से मिनिमम टाइम में क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व कर सके दोस्तों और सबसे इंपोर्टेंट बात है कि हम फॉर्म लाइट एप्रोच पर नहीं जाएंगे हम कोशिश करेंगे कि जितना हम फॉर्मलेस को अवॉइड कर सके उतना हम उसको अवॉइड करने की कोशिश करें संयुक्त उसके अलावा दोस्तों स्टूडेंट्स मैंने देखा है कि कैलकुलेशंस वाले पार्ट में और डिफिकल्टी फील करते हैं लाइक कैलकुलेशंस को हैंडल नहीं कर पाते हैं तो हमारी कोशिश रहेगी कि हम किस तरीके से कैलकुलेशंस को मिनीमाइज़ कर सके दोस्तों दोस्तों मैं आपका 1 मिनट का समय लेना चाहूंगा और बताना चाहूंगा कि मैं किस एप्रोच को फॉलो करता हूं जब भी मैं अपने स्टूडेंट्स को पढ़ाता हूं दोस्तों तो सबसे पहली चीज है कि मैं हमेशा क्वेश्चन से शुरुआत करता हूं और मेरा मानना ऐसा है कि क्वेश्चंस के थ्रू हम थ्री को और बेहतर तरीके से समझ सकते हैं तो हम पहले थ्योरी पर नहीं डायरेक्टली हम क्वेश्चंस पर हम करेंगे और क्वेश्चंस के थ्रू हम प्यूरी इंटरवेंशंस को समझने की कोशिश करेंगे दोस्तों उसके अलावा में जो भी क्वेश्चन से यहां पर कराऊंगा दोस्तों वह मेजर आईटी कंपनीज में पूछे गए हुए क्वेश्चंस होंगे या तो फिर गेट के एग्जाम में कैट के एग्जाम है किसी ना किसी कंपनी ये एग्जाम में पूछे वह क्वेश्चसं को कि मैं यहां पर लूंगा इसके अलावा दोस्तों अपन बिल्कुल बेसिक से पढ़ने की कोशिश करेंगे लाइक बिल्कुल नर्सरी में अच्छे-अच्छे टॉपिक को समझने की कोशिश करेंगे बेसिक अंडरस्टैंडिंग गेम करने की कोशिश करेंगे लेकिन रिपीटिंग थे सेम थिंग दोस्तों जहां पर पॉसिबल होगा हम फैमिली को अवॉइड करने की कोशिश करेंगे क्वेश्चन खुली इस टाइम में फॉलो कर सॉल्व करने की कोशिश करें दोस्तों और उसके अलावा हम शॉर्ट ट्रिक्स पर लाइन नहीं करेंगे दोस्तों आप यहां पर फिर से शॉट होंगे गुर्जर किसी भी YouTube चैनल किसी भी टीचर के पास जाएंगे वह आपको शॉर्ट ट्रिक सिखाता है दोस्तों तो बेसिकली प्रॉब्लम क्या है शॉर्ट फिक्शन दोस्तों मैं मेमोरी जो टर्म है उसकी लाइक अगेंस्ट सुबह जब Bigg Boss मेमोरी समथिंग जो आपको धोखा दे सकती है बिकॉज़ हम इतनी सी मेमोरी में कितना कुछ दूर करके रखेंगे इन आपने टाइम सुनाओ एक शॉर्ट टर्म मेमोरी लॉस तो इसलिए दोस्तों शॉर्ट ट्रिक्स भी जब होती है तो शॉर्ट ट्रिक्स के पीछे कुछ कंडीशन सोती एक कप इन ट्रैक्स को मैं अप्लाई कर सकते हैं कब एंट्रिक्स को में एप्लाई नहीं कर सकते हैं दोस्तों तो अगर वह मेमोरी वाली बात आ जाएगी दोस्तों तो अब सवाल यह उठता है कि कोई फॉर्मूला नहीं कोई शॉट अपनी तो एप्टिट्यूट को पढ़ने कैसे वाले हैं दोस्तों तुम्हें वही बोल रहे हो कि हम क्वेश्चन को मैक्सिमम क्वेश्चंस को लॉजिक के बेस पर कॉल करने की कोशिश करेंगे जैसा कि हम बोलते हैं कि हम एक्चुअली अपने एप्टिट्यूड का यूज करके क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व करने की कोशिश करेंगे दोस्तों अब आप यहां पर वंडर कर रहे होंगे कि लाइक विराट कोहली की फोटो मैंने क्यों लगाई है दोस्तों ऐसी क्या क्वालिटी है जो विराट कोहली को और क्रिकेटर्स से अलग बनाती है लाइक आप सोच रहे में कितने सारे उसने रन बनाए हैं बट वह बहुत बड़ा अचीवमेंट नहीं है दोस्तों मेरे ख्याल से जो क्वालिटी है जो विराट कोहली को और क्रिकेटर से अलग बनाती है वह है दोस्तों कंसिस्टेंसी तो उस तो हमारे यहां पर मेजर फोकस होना चाहिए कंसिस्टेंसी में कि हमको ऐसा नहीं है कि एक दिन लाइक हमने ए टावर्स पर डी और उसके बाद अगले तीन दिनों तक हम नहीं पड़ेगी तो बेसिकली हमको क्या एप्रोच यूज करने कि आप डेली बस वन आवर दीजिए आप फिट को लेटेस्ट मोर थन सफिशिएंट बटन को दिल्ली एक घंटा निकाल है दो अजय को तो दोस्तों यहां पर एक और जो टीचिंग अप्रोच कि मैं बात कर रहा था तो किसी भी टॉपिक को पढ़ने से पहले हरे एक टॉपिक का हम डीजे निलेश करने वाले हैं डेनिश का बेसिकली मतलब क्या है कि किन-किन एग्जाम्स में कितना वेटेज रखता है यह टॉपिक जिससे कि आपको क्लियर अंडरस्टैंडिंग मिल सके कि हम को किस हद तक इस टॉपिक को पढ़ना अगर दूसरे टाइम लिमिटेड है तो अगर आप किसी टॉपिक पर टाइम दे रहे हो तो किसी दूसरे टॉपिक इंपोर्टेंट टाइम आप खेल भी कार्य तो वे टेस्ट के हिसाब से चलना बहुत जरूरी है दोस्तों लाइक अगर मैं आपको टाइम एंड वर्क की बात करूं तो लाइक टीसीएस में टोटल फिफ्टीन एप्टीट्यूड क्वेश्चंस आते हैं एंड वन टू क्वेश्चंस आप यहां से एक्सपेक्ट कर सकते हैं सिमिलरली इंफोसिस की बात करते थे उसमें रिलेटिव थोड़ा कम पूछा जाता टाइम 100 से पॉसिबिलिटी कि आप कोई क्वेश्चन एक्सपेक्ट नहीं करें और मैं भी एक क्वेश्चन आफ एक्सपेक्ट कर सकते हुए एक्सेंचर में आप दो से तीन क्वेश्चंस एक्सपेक्ट कर सकते हैं दोस्तों को 1968 में आप जीरो दो क्वेश्चन एक्सपेक्ट कर सकते हैं विप्रो में आप वन टू क्वेश्चंस आफ अलार्म सेट कर सकते हैं दोस्तों और लाल अगर मैं बात करूं थे जो भी कंपनी का आप नाम लोगे एप्रोक्सीमेटली टेन परसेंट एप्टिट्यूट करे जो है वह सिर्फ और सिर्फ टाइम एंड वर्क से पावरुल है दोस्तों तो बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक एस यू कैन सी लेंगे एग्जाम की भी हम बात करते तो लाइक अगर कोई टॉपिक 10 मार्क्स का आने वाला है कोई सब्जेक्ट उसको मोस्ट इंपॉर्टेंट सब्जेक्ट के डिग्री में रखते हैं दोस्तों इसलिए बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक है और हम बिलकुल बेस्ट पॉसिबल तरीके में इस टॉपिक को समझने की कोशिश करेंगे तो चलिए शुरू करते हैं तो नमस्कार दोस्तों सब्सक्राइब कीजिए नॉलेज किट चैनल को और बैल आइकॉन को दबाइए इस

कि अ हुआ है कि नमस्कार दोस्तों मैं हूं आपका दोस्त यश स्वागत करता हूं आपको इस वीडियो में यहां पर हम एक बहुत ही इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक के बारे में डिस्कस करने वाले हैं एटीट्यूड फॉर एप्टीट्यूड दोस्तों जब भी आप फिट की प्रिपरेशन स्टार्ट करते हैं तो हम किसी ने किसी ऑनलाइन कोर्स को रेफर करते हैं या किसी को रेफर करते हैं तो जब भी आपको को खोलकर देखते तो लाइक में स्टार्टिंग हो जाती है चैप्टर 1.1 यू नो व्हाट लाइक एटीट्यूड रिपेयर करने से पहले हम को यह जानना बहुत जरूरी है कि हम जिस भी एग्जाम के लिए जिस भी कंपनी के लिए बेसिकली एप्टिट्यूड रिपेयर कर रहे हैं तो एग्जाम यह कंपनी में किस पैटर्न पर फिट पूछा जाता है उसके अलावा दोस्तों लाइक मैंने बोला एटीट्यूड और एटीट्यूट तो जनरली जब भी MS Word रिपेयर करते हैं सॉल्व करते हैं तो कुछ डूज़ एंड डोंट्स काम को ध्यान रखना पड़ता है दोस्तों तो उन सभी चीजों के बारे में इस वीडियो में डिस्कस करने वाले हैं इसके अलावा दोस्तों हमारी टीम में रिसर्च की है और हमने कंफ्यूजन ट्राय किया है कि अगर आप एटीट्यूड शुरू कर रहे हो तो कौन से टॉपिक्स मोस्ट इंपोर्टेंट है इन कौन से टॉप इसको आप है लेस इंपोर्टेंट की कैटेगिरी में रख सकते हैं दोस्तों तो इस वीडियो के लास्ट इस वीडियो के लास्ट तक बने रहें दोस्तों चलिए शुरू करते हैं नमस्कार दोस्तों सब्सक्राइब कीजिए नॉलेज चैनल को और बैल आइकॉन को दबाइए इस चैनल की सारी लेटेस्ट वीडियोस तुरंत देखने के लिए तो दोस्तों एटीट्यूड के लिए कैसे रिपेयर करना है वह जाने से पहले मैं आपका 1 मिनट का समय लेना चाहूंगा और बताना चाहूंगा कि एटीट्यूड क्यों इंपोर्टेंट है बहुत ज्यादा उसके लिए मैं कुछ कंपनीज के और कुछ एग्जाम्स के डाटा को ले करके आया हूं आपके सामने जिससे कि मैं अपनी बात को बहुत अच्छी तरीके से समझा सकूं तो सबसे पहला ड्यूटी आता है कि कई लोगों को ऐसा लगता है कि लाइक हमारी टेक्निकल सब्जेक्ट बहुत ज्यादा स्ट्रॉन्ग है तो लाइन हमारा प्लेसमेंट तो डेफिनेटली है दोस्तों ऐसा नहीं है मैं अपने बहुत सारी फ्रेंड्स को देखा है जो टेक्निकली बहुत ज्यादा साउंड है उसके बाद भी प्लेसमेंट में उनको स्ट्रगल करते मैंने देखा कि Bigg Boss फर्स्ट फॉर्म जो होता है वह सिर्फ एप्टिट्यूड चेक करने वाला है स्क्रीनिंग राम होता है तो अगर आप एप्टिट्यूड अच्छा नहीं है तो आप ही बाहर होने वाले टेक्निकल स्किल नो डाउट हुआ आपको एडवेंटेज देगी बट इंटरव्यू राउंड में आपको एडवेंटेज देखिए दोस्तों तो फर्स्ट राउंड के लिए एप्टिट्यूट कस्टम होना बहुत बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट है दोस्तों तो लाइक आप यहां पर देख सकते हैं वह गेट में 50% वेटेज है फिट का कैट ठंड क्वेश्चन 733 क्वेश्चंस एटीट्यूड के होते हैं इसके अलावा मैंने कंपनीज का भी डेटा आपके सामने यहां पर रखा है लेकिन अगर आप इन टीसीएस के फर्स्ट राम की बात करें जाए फर्स्ट राउंड कांटेस्ट होता है उस में 37.04 सिर्फ एप्टीट्यूड है इसी तरीके से आईपीएल की बात करते 60% दोस्तों सिर्फ और सिर्फ एप्टिट्यूट से कवर्ड है उसके अलावा अगर आप एट नगर कॉम्पिटेटिव एग्जाम्स में अच्छी रहेंगे हम कर रहे हैं तो आप एटीट्यूड को नहीं छोड़ सकते दोस्तों कुछ एक मास्टर यहां पर 30401 क्यों चेंज हो जाती है तो इस पॉइंट ऑफिसर एप्टिट्यूड बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट होने वाला दोस्तों उसके अलावा एक और एडवेंटेज के आएंगे एप्टिट्यूड मैं आपको बहुत कमेंट करना दोस्तों और रिजल्ट जो है उसका बहुत ज्यादा रिवॉल्वर घड़ी होने वाले लेकिन किसी भी कंपनी की बात करें तो यह वहां पर एटीट्यूड रहा हूं होता है लॉजिकल रीजनिंग रावत एंड वर्बल एबिलिटी रहा है तो उसे लॉजिकल रीजनिंग और रामदेव ऑप्शनल है कुछ कंपनीज कराती है कुछ कंप्लीट नहीं कराती हैं बट एटीट्यूड साउंड एंड वर्बल एबिलिटी एंड आपको हर एक कंपनी में महीने पहले जैसे कि मैंने यहां पर हाई पीएम का एक डाटा आपके साथ शेयर किया है खिलाड़ी आईपीएल में अगर देखा जाए तो एटीट्यूड नंबर सीरीज बेसिकली नंबर सीरीज को पीएम के रूप में कंवर्ट कर सकते हैं तो थर्टी सिक्स क्वेश्चंस आफ 258 क्वेश्चन जो है वह दोस्तों एप्टिट्यूट के ही आने वाले हैं और उसके अलावा अर्पण-दर्पण क्वालिटी के बाद के twenty-two क्वेश्चंस आते हैं दोस्तों तो अगर यहां पर 3730 क्वेश्चन सॉल्व कर लिए उसके अलावा वाली पहली टीम लाइक हम केवल 10 क्वेश्चन की सॉल्व कर पर दोस्तों तो इट ट्रांसफार्मर 250 क्वेश्चन सा 258 यानी स्विस एप्रोक्सीमेटली 70% और 70% दोस्तों मोर थन सफिशिएंट होता है टॉप क्लियर करने के लिए इन यहां पर आप टाइम अपनी बात करें लाइक व लाइबिलिटी में आपको ट्वेंटी टू क्वेश्चंस पेज मिनट्स मिल रहा है दोस्तों यह आपको एप्रोक्सीमेटली पॉइंट एप्रोक्सीमेटली पट्टी सकें इसमें जो है तो आपको क्वेश्चन को कॉल करना है वह दोस्तों तो वह बहुत ज्यादा चैलेंजिंग होता है तो इसलिए एप्टिट्यूड में आपको स्ट्रैट होना बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट है दोस्तों तो चलिए अब हम डिस्कस करते हैं कि एटीट्यूड में अगर हमको रिजल्ट मैक्सिमाइज करना है तो इसके लिए हम क्या कर सकते हैं जैसे कि मैंने बोला कि जो कि है वह यह है कि आपको पैटर्न को अफसर करना है अगर आप कैंपस प्लेसमेंट की तैयारी कर रहे हैं दोस्तों तो कैंपस प्लेसमेंट में जो है वह केवल कुछ ही टॉपिक्स पूछे जाते हैं एटीट्यूड के सारा एटीट्यूड नहीं पूछा जाता और इवन टॉप इससे भी कुछ पर्टिकुलर सब टॉपिक्स है जो पूछे जाते हैं जैसे कि मैं प्रॉफिट एंड लॉस की बात करूं तो आप किसी भी कंपनी का रिटन एक्जाम देख लीजिए उसमें आपको प्रॉफिट पर सेंट एंड लॉस परसेंट पूछा जाएगा लाइक तो कभी भी वह चैनल प्रॉफिट पर नहीं जाते हैं या कभी भी डिस्काउंट संयुक्त प्रयास से कांटेक्ट को टच नहीं करते दोस्तों इसलिए यह जानना बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है क्लिक इस पैटर्न पर क्वेश्चन पूछे जाते हैं और स्किन हमको टॉपिक गैस पर वेटेज पढ़ना जिसमें बहुत छोटा सा एक्सांपल दे रहा हूं अगर आप टीसीएस की प्रिपरेशन कर रहे हैं तो टीसीएस में फोर्टी परसेंट से ज्यादा क्वेश्चन सेट यह सिर्फ और सिर्फ नंबर सिस्टम पर आते हैं अगर में इंफोसिस की बात करें तो इंफोसिस में भी दोस्तों फिफ्टी परसेंट से ज्यादा क्वेश्चन सिलाजिस्म पर जाते हैं तो यह चीज जाना बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है हमारे लिए कि किस कंपनी में कौन से टॉपिक को सबसे ज्यादा पूछा जाता है जिससे कि हम सिंह गुड नाइट व्हेन अपने प्रिपरेशन कर सकें और उसके अलावा दोस्तों हमको थ्योरी पढ़ना है उसके अलावा प्रीवियस ईयर क्वेश्चन सॉल्व करना 216 बहुत सारे लोग आरएस अग्रवाल को रेफर करते हैं तो चोरी पार्ट आरएस अग्रवाल बुक में नोट बहुत अच्छा है बट जो क्वेश्चन सॉल्व के मोर ओर लेस उस बैंक एग्जाम्स को क्लियर करने के लिए क्वेश्चन सॉल्व कि अगर आप प्लेसमेंट की प्रिपरेशन कर रहा है तो मैं रिक्वेस्ट करूंगा कि चोरी पढ़ने के बाद आप कंपनी स्काई प्रीवियस ईयर क्वेश्चंस को सॉल्व करें उससे आपको ज्यादा क्वालिटी मिलेगी दोस्तों और उसके बाद देखिए बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज है दफ्तर का बैटर लें अगर मैं आपको कोई क्वेश्चन दूं तो मैं आपको प्रॉमिस करता हूं कि आप उस क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व कर लोग बिना फॉर्मूला लगाए अपनी लॉजिकल एबिलिटी से क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व कर लेंगे बगत बगतै अगर आप एप्टीट्यूड क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व करने में फाइव मिनिट्स ले रहे हो तो मेरे हिसाब से दोस्तों कोई अचीवमेंट नहीं हुआ तो वे चैप्टर नोट क्वेश्चन को हमको कम से कम समय में सॉल्व करना है लेकिन यहां पर मैंने 1 लीटर शेयर किया है यहां पर मैंने एग्जाम से इन कंपनियों के नाम लिखे हैं और कितने क्वेश्चंस हमको एटीट्यूड के कितने मिनट में सॉल्व करने होते हैं लेट्स गेट में 10 क्वेश्चन हमको 20 मिनट में सॉल्व करने होते हैं टीसीएस की बात करें तो 15 क्वेश्चन 30 मिनट में हमको सॉल्व करना तो दोस्तों और यौवन आप यहां पर देखिए विप्रो में 16 क्वेश्चन सॉल्व करना तो उनका एटीट्यूड क्यों सिर्फ और सिर्फ 16 मिनट मिलते हैं तो और एवरेज अगर देखा जाए तो हमारे पास से 1.5 मिनट होते हैं दोस्तों नौकरी सेकंड सोते हैं तो इसमें क्वेश्चन को पढ़ना है क्वेश्चन ओं भेजना है और उसके बाद उस क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व करना है सही कैलकुलेशन के साथ और ऊपर से दोस्तों क्वेश्चन जो है वह मिक्स्ड तेल एक पहला क्वेश्चन प्रॉफिट एंड लॉस का गया सेकंड क्वेश्चन परसेंटेज कर रख दिया थर्ड क्वेश्चन फिर से प्रॉफिट एंड लॉस का रख दिया तो एकदम मिक्स्ड क्वेश्चंस आते हैं दोस्तों धूप आसान नहीं होता बेसिकली उसके अलावा हमको फॉर्मलेस का यूज है दोस्तों मिनीमाइज़ करना है लाइक उस नोटिफिकेशन दोस्तों इसमें आपको फॉर्मूला सोचना फॉर्मल लिखना एप्लाई करना उसके बाद कैलकुलेशन करना तो बेसिकली जितनी ज्यादा अंतरिक्ष एप्लाई कर सकते जितना ज्यादा लॉजिक अप्लाई कर सकते हैं उतना ज्यादा लॉजिक अप्लाई करके हमको जल्दी से जल्दी दोस्तों क्वेश्चन सॉल्व करना है उसके अलावा दोस्तों हम को ना एग्जेक्ट आंसर पर नहीं पहुंचना होता है प्रॉफिट परसेंट पूछा तो हमको एक्जेक्टली नहीं निकालने की 24.7 नौ परसेंट यह निकालने बैठकर तो बहुत सारा टाइम खर्च हो जाएगा तो उनको एप्रोक्सीमेट एक है कि हां भाई की 2017 फाइव परसेंट के बीच में प्रॉफिट आ रहा है मोस्ट एप्रुपरिएट ऑप्शन को हमको यहां पर टिक कर देना होता है और वैराम ऑप्शंस एलिमिनेट करके भी आंसर तक पहुंच सकते हैं तो इसके अलावा दोस्तों सबसे इंपोर्टेंट चीज होती है कि आपको यह आईडेंटिफाइड करना आना चाहिए कौन से क्वेश्चन सबको लिप्स करने पर एग्जांपल यहां पर मैंने विप्रो का एक्सांपल लिया तो विप्रो में 16 क्वेश्चन 16 मिनट आपको मिलने वाले नहीं एक मिनट मैं आपको क्वेश्चन सोल्व करना दोस्तों तो कई बार कंपनी क्या ट्रिक खेलते के शुरू में 34 क्वेश्चंस बहुत लेंथ दी रखती है तो इस वजह से क्या होता है कि आप सिक्सटीन उसमें पांच से छह क्वेश्चन सॉल्व कर पाते हो तुमको यह आइडेंटिफ़ायर करना बहुत जरूरी यह कौन से क्वेश्चन को स्किप करना जैसे कि आप यहां पर यह इमेज देख पा रहे हो कि यह जो क्वेश्चन है ब्लड रिलेशन का एंड ब्लड रिलेशन क्वेश्चन दोस्तों अपना बहुत चैलेंजिंग होते हैं तो जनरली मैं कोशिश करता हूं कि इन क्वेश्चंस हों लास्ट में सॉल्व करूं तो नेक्स्ट फ्लाइट पर हम यूज करते हैं तो दोस्तों फिलहाल इस वीडियो में इतना ही था और हमने सारी कंपनीज के सिलेबस को ऐड किया है और हम कंक्लुजन पर आए हैं कि यह जो टॉपिक से ऑलमोस्ट सभी कंपनीज में पूछे जाते हैं दोस्तों अगर आप फिजूल की प्रिपरेशन स्टार्ट कर रहे हैं तो इन टॉपिक से स्टार्ट कीजिए और उसके बाद में कमेंट करूंगा कि आप इन टॉपिक पर चाहिए दोस्तों लाइक इंजीनियरिंग में हमको f5 सब्जेक्ट यूज किए जाते हैं कॉलेज जिसमें बट कॉलेज हमको कभी भी एप्टिट्यूड नहीं सिखाता है एटीट्यूड इस मस्ट गेट ए जॉब दोस्तों मैं अभी आपको यही रेकमेंड करूंगा हमारी पूरी टीम के अपने सीरियल में एप्टिट्यूट को आप इस तरह मिठाइयों के अलग से आपको हैप्पी टू की प्रिपरेशन करना ही पड़ता दोस्तों रोज आधा से एक घंटा आप एटीट्यूट को 2 एंड बहुत आसानी से आपका प्लेसमेंट हो जाने वाला है उसके अलावा एप्टिट्यूड के रिगार्डिंग आपको जो भी डाउट्स ओं आप कमेंट सेक्शन में पोस्ट कर सकते हैं इनमें से जिस भी टॉपिक्स इसमें आपको डिफिकल्टी फील हो रही है आप बिल्कुल कमेंट सेक्शन में पोस्ट करें और हमारी टीम पूरी कोशिश करेगी कि हम जिस फोन में आपकी हेल्प कर सके उस फॉर्म में हेल्प करें तो चैनल के साथ बने रहिए हमारे साथ बने रहिए थैंक्यू कर दो कर दो

कि अ हुआ है कि नमस्कार दोस्तों मैं हूं आपका दोस्त यस स्वागत करता हूं आपके इस वीडियो में जहां पर हम डिस्कस करने वाले हैं मोस्ट ट्रेंडिंग टॉपिक आफ इंजीनियरिंग के बारे में जी हां हम डिस्कस कर रहे हैं कैंपस प्लेसमेंट के बारे में जैसे कि आप देख सकते हैं टाइटल है हमारी इस वीडियो का कैंपस प्लेसमेंट डौ सीजन आफ एवरी इंजीनियर इन सही मायने में कैंपस प्लेसमेंट वास्तव में हर एक इंजीनियर के लिए ऑक्सिजन की तरह काम करता है रिसर्च ऑप्शन हमको सरवाइवल के लिए जरूरी है उसी तरीके से प्लेसमेंट होना भी आज के समय बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट हो गया है इन आप देखते होंगे बहुत जगह आपने कैंपस प्लेसमेंट के बारे में पढ़ा और आपको भी पता है कि कैंपस प्लेसमेंट क्यों इतने इंपोर्टेंट है तो फिर उसके लिए वीडियो की क्यों जरूरत है यह मेरी क्या जरूरत है तो दोस्तों बहुत सारी ऐसी बातें हैं जो हमको नहीं पता कैंपस प्लेसमेंट के बारे में तो इस वीडियो में हम को कवर करेंगे और कैंपस प्लेसमेंट को एक डिफरेंट एंगल से देखने की कोशिश करेंगे तो वीडियो के एंड तक जरूर बनी रही है का यह वीडियो बहुत सारे इंटरेस्टेड इन बहुत ज्यादा हेल्पफुल होने वाली है तो चलिए शुरू करते हैं नमस्कार दोस्तों सब्सक्राइब कीजिए नॉलेज चैनल को और बेल आइकॉन को दबाइए इस चैनल की सारी लेटेस्ट वीडियोस तुरंत देखने के लिए इस वीडियो में हम बेसिकली टीचर क्वेश्चंस के बारे में डिस्कस करने जा रहे हैं जो मोस्ट पीपल को डाउट होता है एंड बहुत लोगों ने इसके बारे में नहीं पता तो इन क्वेश्चंस के बारे में डिस्कस करने जा रहे हैं पहला क्वेश्चन यह है कि टीसीएस इंफोसिस विप्रो जैसी जो सर्विस ओरिएंटेड कंपनीज है उनमें अगर आपको प्लेलिस्ट होना है तो उन्हें प्लेलिस्ट होने के लिए क्या करना चाहिए या क्यों इनक्रीज में प्लेस होना जरूरी है सेकंड क्वेश्चन बहुत ही ज्यादा इंट्रस्टिंग है दोस्तों कि सर 3.5 एलपीए का पैकेज यह कंपनी हमको देने वाली है तो इनकम इसलिए हम इतनी मेहनत क्यों करें और मोरल लेस में कंप्यूटर साइंस बैकग्राउंड से नहीं हुई है मैं कोडिंग में अच्छा नहीं हूं तो क्या मुझे बहुत ज्यादा मेहनत करनी पड़ी कि इन कंपनीज में प्ले सुनने के लिए या मेरे लिए सच में पॉसिबल की है कंपनी ने प्ले स्टोर है या नहीं थर्ड क्वेश्चंस अगेन द मोस्ट * क्वेश्चन जो मोस्टेड से लोगों को डाउट होगा कि मैं कंप्यूटर साइंस बैकग्राउंड से बिलोंग ही नहीं करता हूं या मेरा इंट्रस्ट कंप्यूटर साइंस में नहीं है एंड मैं एंटर करने में इंटरेस्टेड हूं एमबीए में गवर्नमेंट जॉब्स मैन पीसीज में इंटरेस्टेड हूं तो मैं प्लेसमेंट क्लिक क्यों बैठूं और अगर मैं प्लेसमेंट के लिए बैठ अपने इंपोर्टेंट टाइम दे करके और मैं फेल हो गया तो फिर क्या तो आगे ही क्या स्टेप से तो हम इन तीनों पॉइंट्स के बारे में की करके डिस्कस करेंगे तो वीडियो को लाइक जरूर देखिएगा प्रॉमिस इस वीडियो को देखने के बाद आप के कैरियर में एक बहुत ही बड़ा यू-टर्न यह बहुत बड़ा बूट आने वाला है तो चलिए पहले क्वेश्चन फ्रूट्स करते हैं तो यह क्वेश्चन बहुत ही इंट्रेस्टिंग है कि भाई टीसीएस इंफोसिस विप्रो जैसी कंपनी में प्लेस होना क्यों जरूरी है तो दोस्तों मैं आपको एक बात बताऊं लाइक हम YouTube पर जहां भी वीडियोस देखते हैं तो हमसे बोला जाता है कि लाइक Amazon में प्लेलिस्ट सुना है फ्लिपकार्ट गूगल माइक्रोसॉफ्ट जैसी बड़ी कंपनी सुजुकी पैकेज 20l प्लस होते हैं उन कंपनीज में क्या अपने स्कूल हैं उसके बारे में बताया जाता है तो बहुत सारे लोग क्या करते हैं स्पीशीज इंक्लूडिंग स्किल सच्ची है या जिन्हें प्रोजेक्ट वर्क अच्छा किया है तो वह इन टीसीएस इंफोसिस विप्रो जैसी कंपनी इसको इंपॉर्टेंट ही नहीं देते और डाइरैक्टली को ऑफ कैंपस प्लेसमेंट के लिए एप्लाई करना शुरू करते थे और दोस्तों प्रॉब्लम यह है कि अगर आप आईटीआई कॉलेज से नहीं हो एंड कॉस्ट ऑफ इंटरव्यू बहुत ज्यादा होता है तो इसलिए यह कंपनी जनरली फ्रेशर्स को आईटीसी एलएंडटी आईटीसी रिक्रूट करती हैं तो गवर्नमेंट कॉलेजेस में बहुत कमी कंपनीज विजिट करती हैं ऑफ कैंपस सेलेक्शन रिव्यू बहुत बहुत ज्यादा कम होता है कि को स्टफ इंटरव्यू जो है वह बहुत ज्यादा होने वाला है तो ऐसे में क्या करते हैं लोग मतलब स्टूडेंट्स क्या करते हैं कि वह डायरेक्टली एंड कंपनी इसमें अप्लाई करने की कोशिश करते हैं और यह जो छोटी कंपनी इस छोटी नहीं बोलना चाहिए जो कम पैकेज वाली कंपनी टीसीएस इंफोसिस विप्रो इन कंपनियों को हम इंपॉर्टेंस ही नहीं दे रहे हैं जो कि यह मेरा ऐसा मानना है कि लेकिन कंपनी इस पर फोकस करें इन कंपनीज में टॉपलेस हो जाइए पैकअप एक जॉब होगी आपके पास उसके बाद आप ऑफ कैंपस का आसानी से एप्लाई कर सकते हो और इवन इन थिस आपको ऑफ कैंपस में प्लीज नहीं होता है तो मैं अपने बहुत सारे सीनियर्स को देखा है जो इन टीसीएस इंफोसिस विप्रो जैसी कंपनी में 2 से 3 साल ढाई साल दो साल वर्कर के दिनों वह आज बहुत अच्छी जगह पहुंच गए हैं इनकी उनकी ड्रीम कंपनीज में पहुंच गया तो अगर आप इन कंपनियों की प्रिपरेशन करते हो ना तो बेसिक फाऊंडेशन आपका ले होगा कि अल्टीमेटली आपको Amazon गूगल फ्लिपकार्ट जैसे कंपनीज में में मदद करने वाला है तो अपने नेक्स्ट क्वेश्चन पर हम बढ़ते हैं तो नेक्स्ट क्वेश्चन बहुत इंटरेस्टिंग ऐड की सर मैं कोडिंग में अच्छा नहीं हूं और मैं मेरा इंट्रस्ट नहीं है अ व्हाट टो वेयर इज अंतिम है यह 3.5 ब्लैक जैसे पैकेज के लिए मैं इतनी मेहनत क्यों कर और अगर मैं कोडिंग अच्छा नहीं हूं यह सब चीजों में अच्छा नहीं है तो क्या मुझे बहुत ज्यादा मेहनत करनी पड़ेगी और करनी पड़ेगी तो मैं क्यों करूं जब पैकेज उतना कम है उसके लिए इतनी ज्यादा मेहनत क्यों करनी पड़ेगी तो दोस्तों मैं आपसे एक बहुत छोटा सा क्वेश्चन पूछूंगा कि हमारे पास ऑप्शंस क्या बच्चे हैं यह देखना बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है यू नो लाइक मैंने बहुत सारे अपने सीनियर्स को देखा है लाइक उनको 3.5 एसपी के पैकेट वाली कंपनी में जॉब करने मतलब शेमफुल लगता है और वही सीनियर्स आज घर पर बैठकर के एक किसी एग्जाम की तैयारी कर रहे दो-तीन साल से क्लियर नहीं हो पा रहे पेरेंट्स के ऊपर आप बटन बने हुए मैं यह नहीं बोल रहा कि कंपनी एग्जाम्स की तैयारी करना बुरा है या ड्रॉप लेना या घर पर बैठकर तैयारी करना बुरा है बट फ्रेंड्स ट्रस्ट मी इन कंपनीज में प्लीज पुणे बहुत ज्यादा आसान है और आप इन कंपनीज में प्रविष्ट हो जाएगी बैकअप रहेगा आपके पास आपके पास एक बहुत अच्छी और चनेटी होने वाली है ऑप्शंस आपके लिए ओपन होने वाले उसके बाद आप सिविल सर्विसेज है जिस भी चीज की प्रिपरेशन करें अब बहुत आसानी से रिपेयर कर सकते हैं जीवन अलोन विद जॉब भी कर सकते हो और आपको मिर्च ऑप्शन है कंपनी अगर है तो आप उसको ज्वाइन भी कर सकते हो रिजेक्ट भी कर सकते हो अगर आपके पास ऑप्शन ही नहीं है कंपनी नहीं है तो ट्रैक लेने के अलावा आपके पास कोई पॉसिबिलिटी नहीं है तो आई हॉप कि यह चीज क्लियर हो गए होंगे अब जो सेकंड क्वेश्चन है यहां पर यह है कि जब मैं कोडिंग में अच्छा नहीं है तो मेरे लिए पॉसिबल भी होगा Play Store होना या नहीं होगा तो भाई सीधा सा सवाल यह है कि जब पॉइंट है कि जो भी आप रिज्यूम में लिखोगे वह पूछने वाले हैं है तो ऐसा नहीं होता कि मेकेनिकल इंजीनियर है इलेक्ट्रिकल इंजीनियर सिविल इंजीनियर है तो उसे कंप्यूटर साइंस क्वेश्चंस बहुत ज्यादा पूछ रहे हैं पूछेंगे तो एक दो क्वेश्चन पूछे वहीं अगर आपने डिजू में सी प्लस प्लस जॉब वर्क मेंशन किए तो पूछेंगे है न तो आपसे बेसिकली जो क्वेश्चन पूछने वाले हो आप किस टीम के ही पूछने वाले क्योंकि इन दहन व को ट्रेनिंग देंगे जिस भी टेक्नॉलॉजी पर वर्क करना है यहां पर वह आप को ट्रेनिंग देने वाले हैं तो इसलिए जो भी आपका करंट मेन है उसमें आपको अच्छा होना जरूरी है थिस नॉट अट ऑल नेसेसरी कि आपको टैक में बहुत ज्यादा अच्छी हो आप कब्ज एप्टिट्यूट पार्ट बहुत अच्छा होना चाहिए मैं बार-बार इस चीज पर फोकस करूंगा आगे कि एटीट्यूड पाठ इंपोर्टेंट होना बहुत जरूरी है और वह सब क्यों है उसके बारे में जैसे-जैसे हम आगे बढ़ेंगे हम को पता चलेगा तो अभी के लिए बस इतना है कि वोटिंग मशहूर नहीं होगा नहीं मैटर करता है जिस भी ब्रांच में हो आपके वह सब्जेक्ट तैयार होने चाहिए एपिसोड में आप बहुत अच्छे होने चाहिए और रिज़्यूम में आप देखोगे वहीं पूछेंगे तो प्लीज कभी भी रेज्यूमे ना बढ़ा-चढ़ाकर कि लिखना होता कि इंप्रेशन अच्छा का या बटर अगर उन्होंने क्वेश्चन आपसे पूछ और आप आंसर नहीं दे पाए थे इंप्रेशन धरा का धरा रह जाएगा तो मेरे हिसाब से चाहत यह क्वेश्चन भी क्लियर होगा एंड अब हम नेक्स्ट क्वेश्चन पर मूवी करते हैं यह क्वेश्चन सबसे ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट है डिपोजिट मैक्सिमम जो डाट जो लोग मुझसे पूछते हुए यही पूछते केसर में कंप्यूटर साइंस बैकग्राउंड से नहीं है या मैं कंप्यूटर साइंस बैकग्राउंड से हूं लेकिन मैं गेट कि एमबीए की प्रिपरेशन कर रहा हूं मुझे एमटेक करना है गवर्नमेंट जॉब से पीएसयूज में इंटरेस्ट है तुम्हें प्लेसमेंट के लिए बैठूंबी क्यों और ठीक है अगर मैं प्लेसमेंट के लिए बैठता हूं इनवर्टर फ्री अगर मैं प्लेसमेंट के लिए बैठता हूं और मैं अपना टाइम देता हूं और मैं फेल हो जाता हूं तो उसमें क्या होगा मुझे क्या करना होगा तो दोस्तों मैं आपको एक बहुत बहुत छोटी सी बात बता रहा हूं देखिए जो भी कॉम्पिटेटिव एक्जाम है वह इंदौर एंड गेट हो कैट हो फिर शुरू है तो आपकी प्रिपरेशन बहुत अच्छी होने के बाद भी बहुत स्ट्रॉन्ग चांसेस होते हैं आधुनिक समाज में हो सकता है कुछ भी हिरन की वजह से आप वहां पर संभलकर जाओ या आप अच्छा परफॉर्म नहीं कर पाओ तो बहुत ही पॉसिबिलिटी होती है कि आप वह एग्जाम्स क्लियर नहीं कर पाओगे तो मैं यह नहीं बोल रहा कि आप में एग्जाम्स की तैयारी नहीं करना बिल्कुल इन एग्जाम्स की तैयारी करना है मैंने खुद गेट की तैयारी की थी तू पॉइंट यह है कि गेट की प्रिपरेशन से प्लेसमेंट पर कुछ भी फर्क नहीं पड़ने वाला दोस्तों तो यहां पर जो आपको रिक्वायरमेंट है वह यह है कि आप अपने क्लेवरली आप दोनों जजों को मैनेज कर सकते हो कितने स्मार्टली आप प्लेसमेंट की तैयारी कर सकते हो और दोस्तों आप इसका पॉजिटिव सहित देखिए आप जब भी कंपनी के लिए अपीयर करते हो तो लगभग हजारों लोग उस कंपनी में बैठ रहे होते हैं तो गेट का एग्जाम कैट के एग्जाम में कोई भी आपको मार्किट एग्जाम दोगे तो वहां भी हजार लोग आपके साथ होंगे हजार लोगों के बीच में आपका कंपटीशन होगा तो आपको गेट वाला एनवायरमेंट पहले से मिल रहा है और अगर आप कंपनी इसको कंप्लीट लेकिन और कर दोगे खिलाफ मुझे कंपनीज में बैठने ही नहीं है तुम्हें पेमेंट आपको नहीं मिलेगा सेकंड मोस्ट इंपोर्टेंट चीज है जब आपके पास बैकअप पर जॉब होती है ना कि जब भी आप डेट एग्जाम लिख रख्या कोई भी एग्जाम में लिख रहे हो तो आपके लिए ना कॉन्फिडेंस बिल्डअप हो जाता है कि हां मेरा कंपनी में प्लेसमेंट हो चुका है बैकअप मेरे पास है तो इनक्रीज अगर यह गेट का एग्जाम में के लिए अच्छा नहीं भी है या तो मेरे पास बैकअप है तो एग्जाम में एंजाइटी नहीं होगी अफेयर नहीं होगा और आप बहुत अच्छा परफॉर्म कर पाओगे बहन के साथ ऊपर जॉब नहीं है और आप ग्रेड के एग्जाम दे रहे हैं लगातार 23 क्वेश्चन नहीं बने तू मन में यह थॉट्स आने लगते कि भाई एक साल पूरा गेट के लिए दिया 2 साल पूरा ग्रेट के लिए दिया यहां भी अच्छा परफॉर्म नहीं कर पाए और बैकअप पर भी कुछ नहीं है क्या होगा यह सारे थॉट चलने लगते हैं उसकी वैसे हमारे एग्जाम और ज्यादा बिगड़ जाता है तो एक कॉन्फिडेंस मिलता है तो इसके अलावा मैं बोलता हूं कि जो भी थर्ड ईयर में स्टूडेंट हैं अभी करें मिली जिनके 3 महीने चार महीने पांच महीने बाद प्लेसमेंट आने वाले हैं तो उनकी लिख सिंपल सजेशन है भाई के आप अगर अब इसे शुरुआत कर दोगे अभी आधे घंटा आधा घंटा ज्यादा नहीं देना दोस्तों सिर्फ आपको आधा या एक घंटा टाइम देना तो अगर आप अभी से शुरू कर दोगे रिपेयर करना तो आपके पेट को भी एंड कैंपस इसको भी साइड सीरियसली मैनेज कर पाओगी एंड एक बहुत इंपोर्टेंट बात है लाइक आपने अपने सीनियर से में भी यह चीज सुनी होगी कि भाई प्लेसमेंट मत बैठना मैं प्लेसमेंट के चक्कर में पड़ गया वैसे मेरा गेट का एग्जाम में कोई भी कॉम्पिटेटिव एक्जाम क्लियर नहीं तो उस मैं आपको यहां पर बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज बताता है कि अगर आप अभी एप्टिट्यूड पाठ में स्ट्रांग नहीं हो यहां अपनी से प्लेसमेंट के लिए तैयार ही नहीं कर रहे हो तो जब भी जून-जुलाई में कंपनी जाएंगी और अगर आप इन थिस प्लेसमेंट में इंटरेस्टेड हो तो अगर आप एक महीना वहां पर इनवेस्ट करना पड़ेगा उसके लिए आप जो भी कैट की तैयारी कर रहे जो भी प्रिपरेशन कर रहे हो वह इन पर रोक ऑफिस लीव्स बट अगर आप भी शेयर दिल्ली आधा एक घंटा निकालने के लिए तैयार हो तो मेरे हिसाब से शायद आपको सीपियां कैट को कभी भी कॉन्प्रोमाइज़ नहीं करना पड़ेगा प्लेसमेंट के साथ-साथ दे सकते हैं अपने बहुत सारे फ्रेंड सीनियर्स को देखा है थे जिन्होंने प्लेसमेंट के साथ में बहुत अच्छी रहेगी ले करके हैं और प्लस उन लोगों के लिए भी मेरे पास बहुत इंपोर्टेंट में सजेस्ट करूंगा कि जिन्होंने अभी जो भी एक सेमेस्टर में है जिनका के लिए एग्जाम अच्छा नहीं गया तो वह भी भाई अभी तीन-चार महीने में अच्छे-अच्छे ऑफ कैंपस प्लेसमेंट घूमने की कोशिश करो एन अगर आप डेट के लिए दोबारा भी प्रिपेयर करना चाहिए तो मेरा सजेशन यही है कि जॉब इन हैंड के साथ अपडेट की प्रिपरेशन करो पहले आप नेक्स्ट टाइम में नहीं नेक्स्ट नेक्स्ट में क्लियर कर लेना बट विद जॉब बहुत इंपोर्टेंट कि मैंने अपने बहुत सारे सीनियर्स को ऐसे देखा है जिन्होंने लिटरली 12 साल का ड्रॉप लिया एंड सपोर्ट में बहुत अच्छा चेंज नहीं आया यूनिट मैं यह नहीं बोल रहा है कि अगर आप ड्रॉप लेते हो तो फिर हो गया पास होंगे बट मैं यह चाहता हूं कि हम शेट्टी को हाथ में लेकर के चलने गुणों से चलना बहुत इंपोर्टेंट है और बहुत आसान है प्लेसमेंट लेना में दोबारा से चिकन फिश कारों का आपकी प्रिपरेशन बिल्कुल भी नहीं है पर होने वाली है कि एंड मैकेनिकल इलेक्ट्रिकल सिविल ब्रांच वालों को यह बहुत का डाट होता है कि लाइक शेयर सीएसआईटी वालों के साथ कंपटीशन होने वाला है तो क्या होगा क्या हमको कंप्लीट कर पाएंगे नहीं तो दोस्तों मैं आपको बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज यह बताने वाला हूं कि इंटर्व्यूअर को भी चीज पता होती है जो सीएसआईटी इंजीनियर्स है उनको हेयर पैक उसकी जॉब मिलने के बहुत ज्यादा चांसेस अमित व हमारी कंपनी को डिप करके चले जाएंगे बड़े मेकेनिकल इंजीनियर है सिविल इंजीनियर है उनके लिए टीसीएस इंफोसिस में प्लेसमेंट मिला वहीं वेबसाइट ग्रीन है मतलब क्रीम कंपनी उनके लिए विषय यही कंपनी में होगा यह बहुत बड़ी बात है तो वह इसलिए हमारी कंपनी को छोड़कर नहीं जाएंगे तो ऐसे केस में कई बार मेकेनिकल सिविल इलेक्ट्रिकल वालों को सीएसआईटी ज्यादा प्रिफरेंस देते हैं तो यह भी एक पॉइंट है और एक और इंपोर्टेंट पॉइंट यहां पर में लिखा व्हाट इज ए प्रिपेयर एंड फील कि सर मैं गेट की तैयारी कर रहा था आपने कहा कि प्लेसमेंट को भी साथ ले करके चलो लेकिन मैं फेल हो गया तो भाई मैं आपको बहुत क्वालिटीज पधारो गे िक मै एटीट्यूट का 15वां सबसे तेज होता है इन सीरियस हेलो कृपया करके नहीं जानते यू नो तो आप अगर प्लेसमेंट की तैयारी कर रहे हो तो उसमें आपको एक बहुत बड़ा बेनिफिट मिल रहा है कि यह एप्टिट्यूड आपको प्रिपेयर हो रहा है एंड गेट के लिए भी वह फिट काम आने वाली बना कैट एग्जाम देर हो तो वह एटीट्यूड आपके लिए काम आने वाला है एनडीए एग्जाम में भी क्या होता है कि एप्टिट्यूड इजी आता है तुमको लगता है कि टीके कि आप रिपेयर करना है बट अगर आप शॉट वृक्ष वगैरह सीखोगे जितना जल्दी आपके टूट पार्ट आफ सॉल्व करोगे उतना अगर टाइम आपके पास टेक्निकल सेशन में है तो अगर आप रियर के 10 क्वेश्चन को सॉल्व करने में 30-minute लगा रखा मेरे साथ सुबह अचीवमेंट नहीं है तो अगर आपको ट्रिक पता है तो इजीलि वह 10 क्वेश्चन आप 10 से 12 मिनट में सॉल्व कर सकते हो तो जो रेमेन क्वेश्चन से टेक्निकल क्वेश्चंस से उनके लिए आपके पास बहुत ज्यादा टाइम होने वाला है तो प्राइस पॉइंट इस क्वेश्चन का पॉइंट केवल यही है क्यों मैंने स्पेस नाइन फिर साइज़ किया सिंपल सा पॉइंट यही है कि अगर आपको सही तरीका पता है कि आप कैसे प्रिपेयर करना चाहते हो कैसे प्रिपेयर करोगे प्लेसमेंट के लिए तुम बहुत आसान होने वाला है आपके लिए अपडेट के साथ मैनेज कर सकते हो तो भाई अब सर बहुत ज्ञान हो गया बहुत नॉलेज हो गई आप तो यह बताइए कि करना क्या है इन कैसे करना है तो दोस्तों मैं आपको यह बताऊंगा कि हम इंजीनियर है और हम कुछ भी कर सकते हैं और हमारे पास बहुत पॉवर है आप सोचिए कितना टाइम है दिन भर में वेस्ट करते हैं तो एक प्रॉमिस के अगर आप अभी से दिल्ली आधा घंटा भी टाइम देते हो यू नो 1 घंटा भी टाइम देते हो आदर्श एक घंटा इस मोर मोर मोर थन सफिशिएंट आप सिर्फ इतना टाइम प्लेसमेंट के लिए तो आपकी ना गेट की प्रिपरेशन आफ कैट की प्रिपरेशन फॉर योर प्रिपरेशन है पर नहीं होने वाली बट आप जितना जल्दी शुरू करोगे उतना अच्छा एंड एक और इंपोर्टेंट बात सबसे इंपोर्टेंट बात यह है कि प्लेसमेंट के लिए तैयारी कैसे करना है उसके लिए मैं आपको बता रहा बोल रहा है एक घंटा क्यों सफिशिएंट है क्योंकि अगर आपके पास प्रॉपर गाइडेंस है लाइक अगर आपके पास प्रॉपर गाइडेंस टॉर्च लाइट स्टडी मटेरियल है आप स्मार्ट वर्क करते हो तो फिर इतना टाइम मेरे सबसे मोर थन सफिशिएंट है एंड मैंने ऑब्जेक्ट किया है कि लाइक कुछ लोग ऐसे हैं जिनके पास 4455 जॉब ऑफर्स है और कुछ लोग ऐसे हैं जो बहुत मेहनत करने के बाद भी एक भी जॉब ऑफर नहीं है तो उसके पीछे सीरियस इंजरी सही होता कि हम एटीट्यूड पड़ रहा है किसी भी प्लेसमेंट की तैयारी कर रहे हैं प्रॉपर गाइडेंस नहीं है हमारे पास टाइट स्टडी मैटेरियल नहीं है यह हम स्मार्ट तरीके से फर्क नहीं करें तो दोस्तों टाइम हमको निकालना पड़ेगा एंड यहां पर कोर्ट भी दिया हुआ है कि पिंपल से यू कैन नॉट लाइव विदाउट let-up लव आई थिंक ऑक्सीजन इज मोर इंपॉर्टेंट या ऑक्सीजन से मतलब है कैरियर यू नो तो अगर लव वगैरह का चक्कर है या जो भी जहां भी आप टाइम वेस्ट कर रहे हो बेसिकली स्कूल देखें और कैरियर पर फोकस करने का भी बहुत ज्यादा इंपोर्टेंट टाइम है है तो दोस्तों इस वीडियो में इतना ही था अब नेक्स्ट वीडियो में हम एक बहुत ही इंपोर्टेंट टॉपिक के बारे में डिस्कस करने वाले हैं वह चैंपियन इंटेलीजेंट एंड स्मार्ट वेज टो प्रिपेयर फॉर क्रिसमिस की तरफ तो यह चीज हमने डिसाइड कर ली कि हमको प्लेसमेंट की तैयारी करना है बट आप आगे तैयारी आपने बोला कि स्मार्ट वे होना चाहिए प्रॉपर गाइडेंस होना चाहिए तो उसका क्या है तो दोस्तों बिल्कुल भी आप को बरी करने की जरूरत नहीं है पूरी नॉलेज की टीम बहुत मेहनत करी इसलिए लगे हुए हैं हम लोग एंड डिफिकल्ट की प्लेसमेंट को लेकर के बहुत बहुत अच्छा कुछ आगे आने वाला है तो हमारे साथ बने रहिए जुड़े रहिए नेक्स्ट वीडियो की जो साइड से लाइक मैं अपने बारे में बताऊं तो मैं पर्सनली एक कंपनी सब्सक्राइब कर चुका हूं तो मैंने क्या स्ट्रैटेजिस फॉलो कि क्या वह सीक्रेट था इट्स कंपनीज को फॉलो करने के लिए उसके अलावा सेकंडरी बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज है एटीट्यूड फॉर एप्टीट्यूड लेफ्ट तो कोई भी पढ़ लेता है बट एटीट्यूड को पढ़ने के लिए राइट एटीट्यूड कि होना है कैसे हमको एटीट्यूड को पढ़ना है एक और बात बता दूं कि आपको सारा कुछ एटीट्यूड में नहीं पड़ना कुछ टॉपिक्स बहुत ज्यादा वेटेज हैं तो उन पर में चलिए हम को फोकस करना है कुछ टॉपिक से जिम कॉर्बेट इंच कम है तो उन पर हमको इतना ऑफिस नहीं करना एंड एक और इंपोर्टेंट बात है दोस्तों हमारी पूरी टीम ने रिसर्च किया है और एक कंफ्यूजन पर हमने एक चार्ट प्रिपेयर किया कि किन-किन कंपनीज में कितना परसेंटेज कौन-कौन से टॉपिक एटीट्यूड में अलग टाइम एंड वर्क कितने क्वेश्चन पूछे जाते टीसीएस में कितने इंफोसिस में कितने विप्रो में तो आपको पता चलेगा कि किन टॉपिक्स पर हम को इंप्रेस करना है और कि नहीं तो वह हम अगले वीडियो में डिस्कस करने वाले हैं एंड एक और बहुत इंपोर्टेंट चीज है कि हम यह तू डिसाइड कर लेते हैं यह तो पूछ लेते हैं अपने सीनियर से किसी से भी केसर कंपनीज कैसे रिक्रूट करती हैं जैसा कि आप प्लेसमेंट प्रोसीजर होता है बट कुछ सीक्रेट्स है जो रिक्रूटिंग Company को पता होते स्टूडेंट को नहीं पता होते तो जो बिहाइंड अकॉर्डिंग से कैंपस प्लेसमेंट के बारे में उनको भी मैं नौकरी करने वालों अपने नेक्स्ट वीडियो में आ हुआ है

=== What are your Weakness? How to answer this Question In an Interview | Shatarupa Ma&#39;am ===
https://youtube.com/watch?v=O8iT-R2ebOs

Transcript:
hello everyone this is chrpa and today I've bought yet another HR round question that's often asked in every company in every interview to every single person and that is what is your weakness how difficult it is right to really explain someone what is our weakness because we have to make an analysis we have to succeed in that we have to do a proper Market to search we must have a strategy we must have our own identity potential and we must be able to pay the cost for each and every weakness that we mention right so how difficult can it really get to say a weakness that wins heart it's really difficult I would say that it's really difficult to explain a weakness that can really impress someone who's hearing you so to answer all your questions that you had over the time that what is the answer to the biggest weakness of your life I have bought this awesome video I want you to please stay connected till the end because at the end I'm going to give you a sample as well as I'm going to answer this that what am I going to say if I was questioned what is your biggest weakness right so always remember it is a two-way Road okay if there is a strength there will be a weakness we are not a Flawless person and thereby it's important that we really really analyze what is the weakness that we behold right so if we really get through the fact and we know what is the weakness that we have it's really simple and it's become oneway Road and you can really convert your weaknesses into strengths so when someone really questions you this thing in an interview that what is your biggest weakness the students or the candidate who are giving the interview really fall into two basic categories one the person who really tries to upskill or play or try to play a game thinking that this is what the interviewer wants to hear right so never go by that strategy right if someone says that what is your biggest weakness now don't think that he must be expecting that I should be working hard I should have that potential I should be a team leader I should be the game changer it doesn't go that way right we all are different we all are unique and thereby our weaknesses are also different and unique so what do candidates do they generally try to play up a skill that they think the employer wants to hear like for example my big BG weakness is definitely the fact that I work too much now you working too much is not a weakness it's a strength because that is going to affect your career in a later stage right so no one is going to have an issue with the fact that you're working too much so what is the candidate trying to do the candidate is just trying to up playay a skill that he or she thinks that the interviewer wants to listen now let's go ahead and read that what is trying say it says that at my previous job my boss actually had to implement a rule that I needed to be out of the office by 700 p.m. because I routinely stay until 9900 p.m. I did win the award for highest sell through rate though so maybe it wasn't all for nothing right so this is something that you're trying to show off say hello I'm really working hard we I'm really working hard on these uh companies organization so much so that I stay in the office till 900 p.m. and the manager actually had to implement a rule that I have to leave office by 7 so this looks too good to be true right so this shouldn't be the case at all right you shouldn't Uplay a skill that you think would benefit you maybe that this weakness might surely throw you out of the interview because you were trying to act smart so don't do this right second what is the scene second is the students are really honest with the panelist that is also not needed okay don't be too good that people start taking advantage of you right like here the person is saying my biggest weakness is the fact that I freeze up whenever I'm forced to talk to someone I don't know to be honest I'm terrified when I walked in the the door today and sat with you but you have been really nice thank you but yeah I was shaking earlier I just don't really feel comfortable in those situation and I get pretty awkward I'm working on it though so this is too honest okay you don't have to really say that you were nervous while you walked in right what will happen the person will think that you are still nervous and what if you put in front of a client and you have to give the entire presentation you have to convince the client and get the deal done so what will be the problem the problem will be that you cannot do it right so please don't be this honest that you were shivering you were nervous and you cannot manage this kind of situation but you are still working on it please don't try to be this honest with the interviewer even this kind of honesty can get you out of the interview right moving on to what are the rules that your weakness answer should have simply pick up a skill or a trait that you have been actively working to improve okay you can say see in both the above SC uh scenes that I presented that I'm nervous or I work too hard they are a skill or a trade that you have right so what you can do you can please pick up that skill or a trait say them that you have been continuously working to improve on this describe how that trait has ch challenged you in the past talk about the actions that you have taken to improve it showcase the results that you have got out of your action and talk how others have praised or acknowledged you this has to be the five most important points in your answer and that's it you don't have to give them any description pick up a trait tell how that challenged you talk about the actions that you have taken to correct it to improve it to rectify it showcase the result results show what results you got after taking your action and then talk about how people have acknowledged it right so before moving on to something else let me take you back to this app campus monk app it's really new it's really helpful and the link for this app is there in the description box please go check it out we have started a July batch 2 it's really going to help you improve your aptitude Technical and your interview skills as well everything comes under just $4.99 please go and check this course out and go enroll yourself today it's never too late but I really am afraid if you really get late for something then you will miss out this offer as well so please go the link is in there in the description box check it out right away all right so what is your greatest we weakness let's question this to ourselves that what we really think is our greatest weakness right so moving on to the first sample right how are you going to present your question based on the five rules that I told you right let's see are there all the five rules in the past right we are going to pick up a trait that we have come across in the past that was the first point so start with the the term in the past name a weakness like public speaking right name that weakness was a huge challenge for me I would incredibly get nervous when I knew I had to speak publicly I realized this was hindering my progress as an individual and as a professional so I decided to take action and improve my public speaking skills talk about the action that you took and after seven several months working through it I can honestly say that my weakness is something I've started to enjoy and most recently show them that I took a presentation along with my client where I spoke relentlessly and I was so happy about it that my client and my colleagues did congratulate me and I was really satisfied with the results okay so there is an acknowledgement of the colleagues and of the class you have showcased the results that you have taken the entire demonstration entire presentation for the client and that is how you are going to answer a samp uh weakness question right this is a sample how you're going to do it okay now what should be your weakness now how you will be thinking that what can we say in our weakness then right so I've made your task even simpler I've got you a list of things that you can say that what your weaknesses can be please pick up any skill any trade from that and frame your answer in this pattern okay this is a sample pattern that I've given to you frame your answer in that way right so in the next slide see here you have the pattern right asking for what you want fear of rejection feeling inadequate avoiding unnecessary conflict passivity procrastination public speaking and lot and Lots right so pick up any one skill or trait and frame your answer in this sample pattern right so now the most important thing what would I say if I was questioned about what is my biggest weakness right so this is what I would say that in the past public speaking was a huge challenge for me I would incredibly get nervous when I knew I had to get up and speak in front of a crowd I realized this was hindering my progress as an individual and a professional so I decided to take action I asked my teacher manager to allocate 10 minutes in our team meeting each month where I could present on something after a few months of working through my speaking issues I can honestly say it's something I've started to enjoy most recently I coed a pitch to one of our University Gathering where we were to address a crowd of 10,000 students and some delegates for a convocation purpose and it was a big hit my teachers and my friends appreciated my efforts right so you being a btech student you can obviously have a Convocation at your University you being a graduate sorry not only btech any graduate right at your University or your college you might be having convocation you might be having multiple FS you might be having multiple uh meetings multiple things that are happening for public speaking right so you can ask your teacher manager people the teacher who are responsible for you can ask them because I suppose everyone has a team meet okay in the University as well so you can speak there okay so you can frame your sentence like this so I public speaking was a issue I took that up I realized that was hindering my progress and so I have started working on it and this is the result till now that I've got and my teachers and my friends have really really appreciated it all right so it's really not difficult to convince someone with your weakness that can really win Hearts when you say this kind of answer the interviewer will be okay like this person is ready to learn he might fail but then he'll not feel demoralized he'll be motivated and he'll work further okay and yes if we work further we are sure to meet with the best results right and something that we deserve so this is an assignment that I have for you until I get to you the next video on the question that is what is your greatest strength and why so the question here is important that why is this your greatest strength I want you people to think about it that why is this your greatest strength in the next assign in the next session on HR question I'm sure I'm going to get you this answer and I hope you have liked this video and it was helpful for for you so at the end use your weaknesses and aspire to strength thank you everyone and see you in the next session bye-bye
