## Transcript:
Hello prime coders, welcome back to prime coding channel. So in this particular video I will be talking about most repeated interview questions and all of the questions which I going to teach you now are very very important in the perspective of your upcoming interview. You might have wrote cognizant online assessment very soon or you might have already written. So if you are looking to secure a job in Cognizant make sure that whatever topics that I will going to teach you you will make note of this and bare minimum is these topics only. Okay. So without wasting any further time let's start this journey with SQL. So most of the time interviewer first ask about can you tell me the full form of SQL. Now some people say simple query language, structured query language or semantic query language. So please this is structure query language is a programming language for sorting okay for storing manipulating and retrieving data. So these are the three important keywords that you need to say whenever you are explaining about SQL storing manipulating and retrieving data in DB. So database is a system that allow user to store and organize data in a very simple and a layman line so that you can revise every day and fix this definition on your mouth when someone ask you can straightforwardly say this simple definition. If you feel that the pitch is very slow or the video uh speed is slow you can just increase it to 1.25. Okay. So there are mainly four types of SQL commands. Okay. DDL, DML, DCL, TCL. Most important questions. Tons of people whom we went personally, everyone said that they asked this question for sure. And if they are asking this, there are high chances that they can go for acid properties as well. So if you know about asset properties, very good. If you don't know about asset properties, you can just head on to DBMS oneshot video which I've already created there. I've taught this topic in a good manner with a proper easy definitions clear. So DDL, DM, DCL, TCL. So these are the definition you can see data definition language, data manipulation language, data control language, transaction control language. Okay. So try to uh see this thing as DDDT so that it will fix in your mind for long. Okay. Some people do consider DQL as well as an data query language where select command comes under. Now if I'm talking about commands I will highly recommend you to have a sheet of paper write dl DML then write DCL then write TCL okay in that whatever commands that comes under DDL DML DCL TCL write it with their syntax although I hope I have covered in this particular PPT but if I have not this will be homework for you create a sheet and do to the same task and revise every morning. Okay. So data definition which means something some data is relevant to definition that we need to do which is definition language which is deals with database schema and description. You can see the commands create alter drop truncate rename. So as I told you need to create a sheet you have create alter drop truncate rename write the syntax with them okay so that every morning you'll be revising all of the commands with their syntax. DML which means some data has been manipulated. Okay. So if you want to manipulate you need to use those commands which will help you to change the data. What are those? Update. Don't you think update will help you to change the data? Delete. Yes. Data is G uh it is vanished. So definitely delete and we have insert and we have select. As I told some people do consider select as a DQL but you can say manipulation language as well because most of time when we need to perform the manipulation or any kind of operation we need to use select. So DCL which is something has been controlled when something has been controlled then definitely there will be a grant where yes I'm granting you to do this task or there's a revoke for sure if we are if we are giving some permission we should able to evoke that too. So deals with the permissions another control database system command. So see how I am telling you all these kind of topics. So you need to remember in the same way data definition language which means we are defining data. So where we are defining create will help me to define a table. Alter it will help me to add table or change the data types or modify column and drop deleted. So it is just defining the definition either it would be existed or not existed. Okay. So all of those commands come under then data manipulation which means insert inserting into database you have manipulated the full schema. So these kind of things you can do. Okay. So TCL which means transaction control language. So yes, commit roll back save point is the yeah transaction control where we can do the transactions. Okay, although this is a very vast topic I personally like this transition control language. If you want you can just go on Wikipedia and learn about it. So uh create table. So create table statement is to create a new table in a database. So why I have mentioned here? So if you know that I already posted all of the interview experiences on my channel as well as their soft copy has been uploaded on the top mate so that you can easily claim those and go through the content. We have written the answer in such a way that you just need to wit the same in the interview. Okay. So there we found that tons of people got this question first and due to this question is very easy basic no one practice and some do some very very basic tasks such as not putting uh this uh ending close bracket with the semicolon they're not giving proper commas some constraint spelling is not good most of the time foreign foreign spelling please uh prime code members don't do the spelling mistakes foreign reference references you should know properly. Okay. So this is a create table syntax which is create table table name. You have column name data type constraint. You have column 2 data type constraint. You have column 3 type constraint. So yes this is a simple way to create a table. I hope you know it. If you don't know just pause this video and write right away. Okay. So now transform your interview opportunity to the operator so that you can make your parent proud. This is a very very important thing because here you will pro get the full interview simulation. Okay. and with the real experts who crack these kind of companies. Okay, I would say not just I would say cognizant then inoses and few people are working in big problem based companies as well. Okay, so these are the set of metrics which help you out to nail your upcoming interviews. Yes. And that could be you will definitely nail it because you know your weakness. Now you just need to work on those and you are done. If you don't take chance then no one can help you out. Treat every opportunity as the last opportunity and give your best. So for that just come here on the prime coding per consuming your time. You will definitely get full of basket. Okay. So rum√© review will be given to you. Personalized feedback and expert guidance in-depth mog interview and HR and manageral prep. All of the things which is required to crack cognizant will take care of you in that session and it will be more than 90 minutes. Very clear. So now insert value into table update value in the table. Why we wrote in this kind of fashion? Because in the interview most of the people okay if you are able to insert then definitely you will be able to update. If you're able to insert and definitely you will be able to delete. So these kind of uh cluster they form and ask questions based on it. Okay. So how to insert? So insert values or I can say insert into table name whatever table you want to insert and this is the particular syntax. So if you wonder that where you can find this PPT I will be posting in that same package of Cognizant with 10 rupees cost so that you can easily easily get these things. Okay. So insert into customer C ID, C name, age, city. Then we have salary which is values. Okay. So these are the important thing although it is not required to mention the fees as well but it is good practice because one of the candidate directly wrote this but the interviewer explicitly told him to mention what kind of values he is appending into. Okay. So this is a best practice. So if you do this is a charm. So yes this way you can insert most of the rows in a single go. Now people are do confused that in a single insert statement can they do this task? But answer is yes. Some people don't know because they only insert a single row at a time. So it might be they will use insert into customer three four times again. So don't do it. You can do in a single row as well. So update table which is name update table uh name set column name and I would say that update is one of the favorite topic of cognizant. They do ask how update works or can you tell me the syntax of update because most of the time here update table link is required and delete from table name these kind of syntax are most important and it plays very important role in the cognitive interview. So you can see update customer set name to Sam and age would be 32 where the custo ID is four. Okay. So it will update the customer name to Cam. I would say Sam and the age 232 where the cursed ID is four. Very easy and straightforward question as I told you if they started asking you this they will follow the same kind of pattern which is alter table and delete values in table. So the alter table statement used to add delete modify columns in an existing table. That's why we call it as DDL which is data definition language because we are changing data present in my particular database. Okay. So alter table add column alter table customer which is add column gender varcat 10. It will add a column which will store the name or I can say the gender which is less than 10th length. Now if you're using vcad the followup question would be what is the difference between varcad versus cat? You need to explain it with a proper examples. Don't just say sir this is that this is that. Okay. Have a good speaking skills. That's why we do recommend to have mock interviews that you can judge or so that we can tell you that where you are going wrong and it might be you know the topic but you're not able to explain good. That is the main uh important point where people get rejected. So alter table modify column alter table name customer alter column gender 10 can be easily modified as from where I converted into cap. Okay. So this is a question and this is a particular syntax you can make note of it. So alter table drop column you just need to write drop column gender. Okay. So remember remember that drop if you don't use with alter it can only be used to delete or drop the database okay or drop the table but what you can do is if you're using into alter it can help you to drop a column inside a table. So once in the interview if the candidate is too nervous if interviewer ask him to can you drop the table he will write alter table table drop table. So don't do it. So delete values in a table which is delete from table name where condition is this. Now I can say that delete delete versus uh what we studied just now update. Yes, these two syntax is most important. So do practice questions on it. So drop and truncate table is one of the again important question where they can ask you about the versus what is drop and how it is different and truncate. Okay. So and as well as with delete as well as delete. Okay. So truncate table versus delete or drop versus truncate table. So the the drop table com uh commands delete a table in a database. Very simple sober definition so that you can go through and take these things into your mind. Drop table which is drop table name. Okay. So the truncate table command deletes the data inside a table but not the data itself. So truncate table table name will do the stuff which you want. So please let me know in the comment section what is the difference between truncate table and delete table. Okay, which one is faster? Can you delete all rows using delete as well? So these kind of homeworks is there please let me know in the comment section. Select statement which is also called a DQL and DML language. So the select statement is used to select data from database which is select column name from table name. very easy and yeah mind my words these are the important questions and these are very basic questions where people are not able to explain this and these questions do comes under the interview because these are the recently asked questions okay so to select the fields available in the table select star from table name to select that distinct and unique you just need to use extreme column name and you will get those things so where clause without this what you can do in the SQL so where clause is used to call as filter records now people say that where clause is used to put condition. See, we use some technical word which is filter records because here you are just traversing over whole database and filtering out few stuffs on the basis of condition. It is used to extract only those condition records that will fulfill the specified condition and you can go through select column name from table name where condition and where grade A will filter out the records which has grade equivalent to A. Now limit. Now if you study about limit do study about offset because combination of two combination of two will help you out to find minimum and maximum element present in a table. Okay. So element limit cause used to upper limit on the number. If it is five you will get five data. If it is offset offset 99 it will start from 100. These kind of things you should know properly. Order by clause as simple as ascending and another is descending. Okay, these are the two things that you should remember. Order by cause used to uh clause used to sort that element in an ascending and descending order. So yes, you can use AES which is totally a default case. Totally a default case. You don't need to specify ASC. But when you need to uh sort your table in a decreasing order, then you need to mention DC. Okay. Now string functions. Mind my words. I I request all of you to make notes of all of these. Okay. because anytime they can ask you about replace tim concat format substring length so these are the important but most of the time ignored because people don't study uh other than that because upper is also used lower is also used now is also used format is also used but the thing people use very less which is which is uh length substring like concat replace trim substring and length these are the things used very very rarely so Don't miss this kind of thing. So, convert the value of the key to lower case. Return the length of the string. Whatever keyword states the definition is resembling those keyword definition, isn't it? Length will return you the length. Substring extract substring from a string. So, yes, please make note of this and prepare for your interview. And what I will recommend you to have a note and write a syntax of replace or how output will look like because sometime interviewer told to create output in front of them on the paper itself. So aggregate function which is CSA which is CSA people do say CSK but I say CSA and MMR if you watch the boys we have triple M here we have double M R. So this is the way to remember all of the uh aggregate function. We have count, sum, average, max, min, round. Now another part is when you are using aggregate function there are high possibility that you will use group by versus having. Okay. Okay. So you need to study about group by having with the definitions. And if you're not able to have a good content, what you can do? You can watch SQL oneshot which I uploaded on my channel or you can see in the I button or pin in the description below or DBMS oneshot video. It will help you to prepare for your upcoming interview. For sure it has more than 40,000 views in both of the video and definitely it will help you out. So uh you can go through the aggregate function. If you're using aggregate function, we are more likely to use any group by or having so that we can just have those aggregated value at a single place. So yes, please make a note of this and do prepare for the pop-up whatever I'm mentioning. So group by and having clause is also here mentioned here itself. So blue by statement groups that have the same values into the summary rows and it is often used to aggregate functions. Okay. So count, max, min, average to group the result set by one by more columns and you can see this is the particular syntax group by name. Please study about the precedence. Yes, this means that which will be given first like select will come on the very first then prompt then group by then having you can't use in the other format whatever I know if I'm wrong please correct me in the comment section but I believe that you need to study about the precedence for sure like what is the execution flow of uh SQL depending upon the keywords. Okay. So having clause having clause is used to apply filter on group by data because group by will find out everything in a group. Now it is required to filter those things according to the respective uh clause. Okay. So select column names from table name where conditions is grouped by column name and having the uh particular condition because group by will take out all of the data and having clause will filter out the data which we don't need. So that we have group with the data which we need. Okay. Because sometime we use we need only two datas in a present group. So we can just write having count star greater than two or less than two depending upon that. Okay. So now very most important topic that we're going to discuss is now SQL joins. These are most important things. So join clause is used to combine data from two or more tables based on related column between them. So you can see left joint, here you can see right join and you can see full join and you can see ah inner joint. Okay. So yes whenever someone ask you about joints just this pictorial representation should come into your mind so that you won't be missing any of the important points of joints. So you can see here joins return the record that having a matching value in both. You can see then you have full join which is returns all the records when there is match either in left or right table. Okay. This is example of full join. We have a right join. It will return all the data present in the right joint as well as the match data present in right and left joint. It will all return all the data present in left joint with the data which is matched between left and right set. Okay. So these are the definitions and this is the most important thing. Whenever I have interview, I do go through this topic. So, please have a screenshot or write it right away or claim it on the top mate so that you can revise every every uh coming day. Okay. You can see we have we have right join here. We have right join here or I cannot right join man. This is left side of it. So, left join left join here. You can see left join with their particular syntax how to implement it. Not only for left join, inner join, left join for right full join, then we have full outer join, then we have right join, we have right join. So please make sure that you will be going through all of these kind of topics very clear and please make sure that you will see these kind of examples because people do know about this. But if I say that you don't need to return the matched value of B, how you can remove those values? So you should not fumble there. Okay? So you can see cells join we we will talked about most important joins one by one. Now cell join is a regular join in which table is joined to itself so that you can apply the relation or the join operation on a single table. So self join are powerful to comparing values and column within the same table. Sometime it is required. Okay. So yes this is the respective syntax where you need to write the column name. Then the which table you want to access as you need to do give some allying so that you can use like employee e E do id or something you can do. So join whatever join you want to perform and table as t2 and you will get the same very clear. So uh t2 employee name t1 employee name from employee as t1 join. So this is a question which is you can see find the name of the respective manager for each of the employees. So you can see respective manager we have a manager ID with us. Okay. And you need to find the employees with their respective manager. So I applied the inner join and simply wrote that the employee ID is given because when you are joining two things there should be an attachment. So what is this attachment? That is a primary key or the foreign key of the next table. So yes T1 of employee T1 T2 of manager ID. It will get you the employee names with their respective manager names. So I have two slides of question. I will recommend you to read only questions and write the solution by yourself. Okay. These questions are previously asked and altered by our team so that you can uh practice practice practice. You can see the questions are of very very medium level. It is not that hard and everything is shown on the screen. That's why I'm not teaching you the solution. I believe the solutions are very very easy. If you heard about the logic which I stated and you did the homework, you are good to go. I will put this PBT into this segment which is cognizant latest interview experience questions and answers. Uh you can get these SQL PDF oneshot video uh notes here itself and it cost you rupees 10 only rupees 10 only which is less than uh 20 rupees kur chips packet okay on ice cream strike.
