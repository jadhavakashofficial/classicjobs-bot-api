हैं तो इस वजह से प्रकाशित पिंपल यहां पर दोस्तों चैनल कुशवाहा ज्यादा आज विटामिंस मैनेजमेंट सिस्टम थोड़े एपिसोड में यहां पर लेकर आ रहा हूं पहले एपिसोड आपके साथ बैठा होता है वह डेटाबेस क्या होता है और रिसेंट एपिसोड में आप जिस आपने सुना देता है इस विशेष के बारे में जो शुगर से सदस्यीय सर्च ऑनलाइन रोजगार स्पेशल प्रोगाम वास कैंडी क्रश लेट्यूस अभी सारे आपने सेक्शन टिकट मिलेगा तो एपिसोड में हम देखेंगे कैरेक्टरिस्टिक ऑफ़ द हेरिटेज लुक रोज सब्सक्राइब नियुक्तियां सब्सक्राइब सिस्टम आखिर क्या है मिड-डे-मील और जो यूज करें और चैनल सबस्क्राइब नहीं किया तो subscribe पे कि यहां पर फर्स्ट विसर्जित की ओर बढ़ते हैं बन जावे सब्सक्राइब नहीं चाहेगा कि सिस्टम ₹1 है यहां पर पर्स में ही सिंपल है तो यहां पर यह डूबने से मौत हो गई कैटेगरी 98% आंसर घंटे डाटा वे सब स्कोर पर थे फर्स्ट डे सेलिब्रेशन आफ डाटा बेस सिस्टम यहां पर देखिए इसका हिंदी में मतलब यह होता है कि डेटाबेस सिर्फ डेटाबेस कोई नहीं कार्यकर्ता-नेता बीच कोई नहीं सेंटर्स तथा डाटा सब्सक्राइब कर दे कर सकता है अध्ययन करता है और जो भी डेटाबेस का ऑप्शन है यहां पर देखिए यह जो डावेस करता है इसमें डालते है और मिशंस होती ये जो इन्फॉर्मेशन खासतौर होती है उसको क्या देख लो फॉर नेटवर्क कैसे मैटर रहता है इन्फॉर्मेशन स्टोरीस बैटल आफ कैटल आख्यां तै सच्चा दोस्त है

Transcript:
hello friends I will come all of you to all in the study for you one step solution for all your placement needs friends this is Prateek saver store here and in my today's video I am going to discuss few of the aptitude question which will be very important for your upcoming Theseus in Duty 2020 examination and all other placement exams like Alcott a litmus and coke cubes so friends in my today's videos i will be discussing salt tricks also because i have expertise in finding out saw tricks for the questions friends so let us start with the question number 1 so rates question number 1 how many two-digit numbers satisfy this property the last digit that means unit digit of the square of the two-digit number is 8 now friends my answer directly will be option D even 5 second is also more than sufficient to answer the question as soon as I read the question my answer will be none of these now friends let us understand the question let us go to the basic and then you will be also able to answer quickly now friends how many two-digit numbers satisfy this property the last digit unit digit of the square of a two-digit number is 8 now friends let us understand what is unit digit so XYZ so friends this will be your unit digit and this will be your tenth digit and this will be nothing but friends your 100 digit right and this will be friends your 100 digits so this everybody knows now they are asking how many two digit number are there if will make a square of them the unit digit will be eight that means the last it is it will be eight suppose friends if I make a square of 12 I will be getting the unit digit is 4 so how many such two-digit number are there it will make a square we will get eight as unit digit so friends friends I wanted to tell you you make a square of any number one digit two digit 3 digit any number square you make it will never end with it and with two three seven and eight it will never end with two three seven and eight friends please keep this in mind it will never end with two three seven and eight friends in other way I can say there cannot be any perfect square which will end with two three seven and eight sevenths 144 is a perfect square so there cannot be any perfect square which will end with two three seven or eight so then that is the reason I told the answer will be none of this if you want to verify friends you can verify one square will be one C 1 square will end with 1 2 e square will end with 4 3 square will end with 9 6 is 4 square will end with 6 5 the square will end with 5 6 in square will end with 6 7 square will end with 9 8 square will end with 4 9 square will end with 1 and 10 square will end with zero but none of the square will give you 2 3 7 as the unit or last digit so friends I hope this question will be clear moving towards question number 2 now friends let's see how can we solve question number 2 so range question number 2 is a very good question and you can see the length of the question is also more but the solution is very simple friends okay now so friends here also we will be using some kind of sort tricks which may be option attack so friends using option we are going to attack to the question so let's a group of friends decided to go on a picnic with an estimated expenditure of 960 rupees but at the last minute 4 of them did not turn up as the consequences the remaining ones had to contribute rupees 40 extra the number of friends who went to picnic okay let's consider friends option II so the number of friends went to picnic so suppose friends eat friends eight friends went to picnic but how many where plan friends say whatever plan friends four of them did not turn up so it's eight friend went on picnic but actual planned well to a low friends to our friends okay now friends because of some reason for friends did not turn up for friends did not turn up so only eight friends went on picnic okay now now friends you see for this 12 friends the expenditure estimated was nine sixty rupees nine sixty rupees that means friends for so that means friends for one person for one person how much money was planned 1960 by twelve that is nothing but eighty rupees so friends 80 rupees was planned for one of the person right okay now for did not turn now now friends this 960 rupees this 960 rupees will be divided will be divided between the eight friends so now everybody will have to give 120 rupees now Prince you can see now friends you can see as a consequence the remaining ones had to contribute rupees 40 extra so everybody will be contributing 40 rupees extra that means your option a is correct so friends obsolete 12 friends were planned and the estimated expenditure was 962 rupees so per head it was 80 rupees but because of some reason for prints did not turn up so only eight friends are going or eight friends vent so rents 960 will be divided by 8 that means 120 rupees each one has to give so friend earlier 80 rupees and then 120 and they are clearly telling 40 rupees extra everybody paid so option a will be the correct answer so friends this kind of question instead of framing equations you can easily solve it by taking option now friends moving towards the question number 3 let's see the question number 3 friends so a man took loan from a bank at the rate of 12 percent per annum at simple interest he had to pay five thousand four hundred rupees interest of three years the principle amount borrowed by Hamas survey this is a question of simple interest so the question itself is very simple and now Prince we can make more simple by using option okay so now friends in three years that person that man is paying five thousand four hundred rupees interest and the rate of interest to us twelve percent so twelve percent per annum for one year it was twelve percent so friends for three years three years the total rate of interest will be nothing but 36 percent and this 36 percent is nothing but friends 5400 which man is which man will be paying to the bank okay now so when it's what will be principal so friends you see a principal two thousand thirty six percent will be what two into 36 72 but but the person has paid the but the man has paid five thousand four hundred so option a is wrong answer now 36 percent of 10,000 so one into 36 it will start with 36 so this will not be your answer option D so option difference nothing but 20 into 36 so 36 into 2 will be again starting with 72 so option D will be also not your answer so bridge you can directly say option C will be your correct answer if you calculate 15,000 36 % friends it will be giving you it will be giving you 5400 so friends for the 3 year the interest will be 36 percent so it's which option 36 percent is five thousand four hundred so option a B and D is eliminated so obviously option C will be your correct answer so friends with this easy method quick method with the short rates you will be able to help will be able to solve the questions in exam in few seconds moving towards the question number 4 friends now let us see question number 4 which is a question from time and walk and again friends with the help of short rates we are going to solve in less amount of so Prince Raju alone can do a piece of work in ten days Manju alone can do the piece of work in 12 days they undertook to do it for four thousand eight hundred rupees with the help of Anand so with the help of Anna if Raja Manju and Anand worked together they completed the work in how many days five days okay now what has been asked in the question friends then the amount paid to Raju and Anandi so rent if we have to calculate the amount paid to Raju and Anand so we need to get their efficiency because friends always the amount will get divided in terms of efficiency if you are more efficient you will get more money if you are less efficient you will get less money so now friends what we will do we will use LCM technique or mountain know technique so friends please watch my time and work video then you will be easily able to understand this okay now so let's pick LCM here so either you take LCM or you take a number which is divisible by all three no need to take calcium you can assume a number which is divisible by all three or you can take LCM now as soon as you take LCM that becomes our work okay now 60 divided by ten six sixty divided by 12 five and sixty divided by five it will be 12 and that becomes our efficiency what is efficiency means if a sensing is one day work in one day I can solve for question that is my efficiency in one day you can solve 10 question that is your efficiency okay now so friends you see Raju Manju and Allen efficiency is 12 okay Raju Manju and annan efficiency is nothing but 12 whereas Raju plus Manju efficiency is nothing but 6 plus 5 6 plus 5 is nothing but 11 so Brent Raju and Manju efficiency is nothing but 11 so what will be deficiency 12-11 that is nothing but one that is nothing but one so on an efficiency we have got one so now friends here I can write here I can write friends so Raju Manju and anon efficiency so Raju efficiency is 6 that means Raju can do six working read a mandu efficiency is 5 and Anand efficiency here we calculated 1 their efficiency we got okay now Fred this total money 4800 will get divided in the efficiency ratio now prints you can see 6 plus 5 plus 1 so all three efficiency will add and this only will be divided in terms of this only will be divided in all 3 person so when's 12 will be equal to 4800 so 1 will be equal to 400 so 1 will be equal to 4 thousand eight hundred divided by 12 will be nothing but 400 now friends what they're asking in the question how much Raju will get so when it's Raju 6i Raju 6 so 1 is equals to 400 so Raju will be getting 6 into 400 is nothing but 2400 me Raju will get and friends what will get Ireland so anon is 1 so 1 is equals to 400 so Anand will be getting 400 I can write down here friends Raju will be getting 2400 and Anand will be getting 400 rupees now friends so today we solved for question if we have any doubt please put a comment in the comment box I will definitely be able to help you out and

Transcript:
hi my name is Nicole Glasgow and welcome to online study for you today our topic will be on things to consider when introducing yourself in an interview now as you know preparing for that interview interviews can be so nerve-racking and and you can be filled with anxiety as you are anticipating the upcoming interview in a place where you've never been to perhaps and careful preparation and information can be very very helpful in giving you a successful interview okay the first things that we need to think about when you are going to an interview is number one research research what research the company that you're interviewing for it could be an organization it could be a school it could be a business center whatever it is research it we have online information that's that's accessible at our fingertips we have you could have a brochure you could even request some more information from the company to find out everything you can about the company and also the profile the the job profile that you are applying for this is very important one of the most important things and I have noticed that in my life as well applying these concepts have given me much success alright so researching the company find out as much information as you can about the company and the role in which you're applying for and once you do that if any questions arise they will should it shows that you have interests you've shown interest in in that job you've shown interest about the profile in which you're applying for and that you know exactly what you want which will impress the interviewer worse and it will give you an advantage the second thing that you need to think about is dressing appropriately now as you know appearance plays an important role when you meet somebody new if you go in this streets out there or if you if somebody walks in through the door of a restaurant whatever it is we basically know that even we form an impression about the person we just saw ok first impressions are everything in an interview like this because there's so many other interviewees who are waiting out the door or waiting their turn and the competition is very high so you just have to cover your bases so choosing what to wear in an interview is as important as the preparation of pepper repairing part of it and it will tell you who you are based on you know your dress different offices have different work cultures so some offices may be very very formal like what I'm wearing right now is pretty much formal I think and some office cultures are not as formal but it's very safe to at least choose clothing that are considered business formal now different cultures also have different requirements in India I do know that the Indian ethnic wear can still be considered business but if you go to a foreign country such as the United States or England or you know some parts of Europe it is better to wear something that's business casual you know that is quite acceptable or something that is the traditional business attire that is accepted worldwide all right now when you choose your dress it's also important to know that you can be yourself so don't choose something that you're so darn completely uncomfortable in okay choose clothing that's not too tight choose clothing that will not come out of it seems you know you have to always watch out for to cover yourself ok those things may not be very very it can be distracting okay it can be distracting and you just have to eliminate all kinds of distraction that take the interviewers away from there focus on the right parts of you and it's not just the clothes okay so choose the comfortable clothes be yourself keep the focus on you don't wear extravagant jewelry okay this is not extravagant for the ladies this is not extravagant jewelry it's just perfect big jewelry or bright if even if you wear bright colors make sure that they're solid colors not so many prints all right these all of these things really make a difference because when you have when there's too much going on in your clothes it can distract in the wrong way alright say another thing for example in today's world we have the there are some people like me I mean I don't have piercings but I have tattoos alright if you are somebody who has tattoos it's better to cover it up if you have someone who has different piercings in your face except for the nose ring it is better to take it out so when you prepare yourself and dressing appropriately and choosing your outfit make sure that you choose something that is more traditionally and globally accepted alright and again be comfortable and and and and know that you know if you really want this job that you have to do everything possible within your power to make that happen so feel good about the clothes that you're wearing when you leave your house okay and make sure that it does scream out hey I am confident I am well dressed alright and I take I pay attention to detail okay so these are things that you can also do all right the next thing that you need to do to prepare yourself to introduce yourself in the company is in an interview is prepare what you're going to say alright so first we talked about researching okay this is not just preparing what you're gonna say you're researching the company you're researching the role the second thing is dress appropriately now the third thing is prepare what you're going to say alright in this thing you know you just have to look through what kind of interview questions might be thrown at you and there are lots of things that you can consider and write down yourself so having a gist of what may be asked you would be very very wise alright it's very advantageous to prepare yourself and what you're gonna say number the next thing is be aware of body language okay some people may not really keep this you know as something very important but it is alright body language can tell a person how confident you are or how defensive you are so no folding your hands cuz usually folding your hands is kind of considered in nonverbal terms a self defence kind of position so keeping your eyes hands down alright and and having eye contact is very important it also and also maybe putting your shoulder back and lifting your face not looking down lifting your face a little bit not too much because it looks like you're it could be a proud kind of look but just just looking them straight in the eye and having a friendly demeanor alright you can practice this at home in front of the mirror in front of friends or family just to make sure you're portraying the right look okay practice makes perfect by the way alright so even the body language that you portray goes a long way in an interview okay now going back to preparing what you say remember that you can also write down those notes and take those notes with you so that you don't forget what you're going to say when you're nervous it's very very easy to forget what you're going to say so it's very important to do that so technically you know basically when when you are asked a question you know it's easy to lose your train of thought you know so like I said we will reinforce writing down the main points of what you would like to include maybe even some things that you have not included in the resume all right in a resume you have all your professional and your educational background so they already have that in you in their hands or you could give it to them again if they don't have it so keep that prepared but anyway so be prepared with your notes be prepared with your you know ideas and so that you will not you're not going to be caught off guard all right so here we have already talked about researching the company second we talked about dressing appropriately third we talked about preparing what to say and fourth we talked about being aware of body language now the fifth wave is to say best ways to introduce yourself so now we're going to go to the crux of this whole talk about things that you need to consider when you're introducing yourself in an interview now when the best ways to introduce yourself we're going to divide into three parts number one before the interview number two during the interview and number three after the interview okay now when you go into in for an interview you might have made an appointment but it's likely that you're going to be waiting outside until they are ready to call you in alright you could be waiting with a lot of other interviewees or you could be alone but whatever it is it's equally important to be aware of how you're sitting outside before the interview it's gonna be very easy to take out your phone nowadays and just look through you know stuff and your Facebook or whatever and you know while you're passing time it's one of the most common ways to pass time nowadays when you're waiting for something but I would like to advise you that this would not be the wisest thing because you are still be being watched and these small little details do count at the end of the day because there are other interviewees who are equally as good as you are or better so these small attention to details important just sit you know put your legs down maybe touching the ground or even you can cross your legs and and sit and be alert okay be alert you could even take a book along to read because reading nowadays is a lost art and I guarantee you that many people will be impressed that you're reading a book okay instead of always looking at your art or your phone okay do it and so that's one part and when you're coming into the interviewee place you'll be probably talking to a reception or different people you're meeting greeting is also something that's still important I mean I myself when I am interviewing people the way they talk to me or my receptionist or whoever it is will play a small role or maybe it depends on what someone considers really important in can you know regarding that as an impression of that person okay and so you can just you know put out your hand and shake their hands if it's appropriate or you do a little bow sometimes that's appropriate I don't know what's appropriate in your context but think about what is globally appropriate or appropriate for that company and do a correct greetings day hi I'm Nicole Glasgow and I'm here for the role of graphic design my appointment is at 9 o'clock and so they will you know write your name in and and those things are really important say your name say the position that you're you know applying for and that those things are really important before the interview okay now going to the middle point during the interview during the interview it is very important to consider you know just as I said as you were preparing what to say those things are important you need to realise that they're looking for confidence they're looking for knowledge they're looking you know they will be waiting for you you may want to use that time to you know take a drink of water before you go into the place you know so during the interview and you enter the room confidently but with let's see I don't like people coming into the room overconfident either so you have to have that middle balance all right stating your name shaking their hands and smiling okay remember when they say their names let's say the person I'm going to be speaking to is Sanjay they'll say hey come on in and I'll say hey my name is Nicole Glasgow and then they will say my name is Sanjay is he nice to meet you Sanjay okay it is good to mention their names now I'm really really bad with names so if by chance you're like me and you forget it's okay to call them Sir it's okay to call them ma'am okay especially in the Indian context it's not that accepted and not excited use the word accepted normally in the West people are more casual and the way they address one another even if they're older or more senior but it's okay I mean it's always safe to just say sir and ma'am let them be the ones who correct you and say oh you can call me this and try to remember the name even if you're bad at remembering like I am okay and it is likely the interviewees interviewers know the role that you are applying for so you can be like you know you could say something like it's great to meet you talk about this role of events team or this role of graphic design or this role of team lead or whatever it is and once the introduction has been made and you can either give them the hard copy of your resume or they already have it or you can say hey you know I see that you have your resumes here I have brought some of my own in case you didn't okay so you can exchange the pleasantries as the conversation will go on now one of the most common interview questions is tell me about yourself okay so prepare for those most common commonly asked questions but tell me about yourself is one of the literally the most common interview questions so you can already prepare that in advance back at home write and write down your little notes that you want to emphasize on so the highlights of what you want to emphasize on it and include something that the resume does not have okay the resume is just you just have to just briefly look at it and it's about you your profile but there are some things beyond that resume which we'll talk which will give you you know like strengths that give you an advantage in that kind of rule so maybe you could mention some strengths that you have that would be something that will enhance or fit into the role that you're applying for okay so keep in mind that as well alright what and another thing is be prepared that you know to calm your nerves all right keep keep your keep your nerves calm it's very very like as especially when you have so many like maybe two or three people sitting with you I mean I went to an interview once and they were like five of them in the panel and they really intimidated me they were dressed so perfect the hair was perfect their you know their faces looked perfect like it was etched out of a magazine and here I was feeling really really frumpy and insecure but never never let that show in your face and it would help if you had some additional vocabulary in your preparation notes that you can use to increase the quality of the way you describe your roles you describe your thoughts you describe how important this position is for you and why you think you'd be a good fit in a company okay so language is very important as well vocabulary is very important okay now after the interview when the interviews all finished you're nervous oh you know after the interview make sure you stand up and shake their hands and say and mention their name hey it's very nice to meet you Sanjay it was very nice to meet you shake their hand I look forward to hearing back from you okay so those are some of the phrases tissue and use now it would be a very very long video if we go into detail in all of these things but this is just a basic introduction of what you can think about and prepare on when you're introducing yourself in an interview let's review really quickly again start by researching the company and the role in which you are applying for number to dress appropriately and don't don't allow any distractions avoid distractions and number three prepare what you're going to say all right preparation is everything number four be aware of body language number five best ways to introduce yourself so there's a before the interview during the interview and after the interview and most of all best overall advice I can give you is be confident and comfortable okay be confident and comfortable be prepared and just be yourself all right and but if being yourself is not that great don't just as kidding but yes all of these things you can keep in mind as you prepare for your interview so good luck and take care until the next video
