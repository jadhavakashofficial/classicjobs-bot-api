[Music] [Music] hello friends i am lukesh and welcome back to the channel friends this video is very important because in the previous video i already discussed that how i cracked the infosys certification exam with all round process but this video is basically about how to start preparation for nptq examination 2021 as i already said that for the 2020 and 2021 batch exam is already done so for 2022 batch and for the next further batches exam is scheduled for the 2022 batch exam is scheduled in the month of february 2021 or later it will be released soon by infosys so in this video i am talking about qualifier round syllabus strategy structure of qualifier round so let's start the video friends we know that infosys conduct nvtq exam every year so as i already said that exam is already conducted for the 2020 and 2021 batch so for 2022 batch there is no more time for the preparation because only one month one or half month is left for the preparation but believe me this time is only for preparation and you need to prepare and ready all the syllabus before exam so this is the start of preparation we know we have less time but you need to start preparation from today this time because nptq exam is scheduled after one to two months firstly i start with the general introduction that what is the qualifier round structure of qualifier round syllabus work qualifier round resources strategy to crack in first attempt so friends i already i also talk about the pattern of qualifier round exam and how it can be categorized into different section i am also talking about the call cut off criteria for the qualifier round which is the important discussion in this video because at the time of result infos is not release the particular score so what is the selection criteria for the qualifier round we discuss later so here is the first slide what is the qualifier round so friends qualifier round is basically first round and first part of the infosys certification exam after that final round and interview held but you need to first clear qualify around before participating in the next round the qualifier round of infosys certification will have 40 multiple choice question according to the previous year criteria or pattern to be answered in 60 minutes you have 60 minutes and there is a 40 multiple choice question each correct answer will give you one mark and each wrong answer will deduct 0.25 mark means friends there is a negative marking in qualify round at my time i participated in the exam so there is a no negative marking in the final round so there is a negative marking in the qualifier round so be prepared that if you attempt any question so be prepared sure with the answer that you have write the write this answer so friends let's talk about the structure of qualifier round qualifier round is the first round of the infosys certification exam as i already told that there are 40 questions time is equals to 60 minutes means you have 60 minutes and you need to solve 40 question one mark is equals to correct answer wrong answer is equals to 0.25 mark so talking about structure from previous year 2021 infosys introduced for the 2021 batches infosys introduced qualifier round in the infosys certification exam but at the time of 2020 badge there is no qualifier round so every year they implement exam with new extent so prepare for the exam so friends before filling you need to know about some important points about qualifier round because this point is very important because we all need know to the qualifier round structure that these are the pattern there are the questions 20 questions of java dbms aptitude but we don't know the important point before filling form or selection sorts for qualifier round or for selecting slots for qualifier round you need to first register on npt cube so now i will make video on how to register on nptq without any error because your one mistake will cancel your registration yes friends so first register and whenever slots come for your batch there is a mail sended by infosys on your email that you can register for infosys certification friends when filling form or selecting slots you need to select one programming language from java or either python because there is a two language present in the infosys certification exam so you need to choose anyone from them please aware that you choose one programming language confirm selection because after selection you cannot change them again so please sure selection before any programming language so friends as i already told that the qualifier round of infosys certification is structured into three section there is a java slash python 20 question means you selecting java so there are 20 questions of java you are selecting python programming language so there is a 20 question of python programming language there is question of dbms 10 questions of dbms are also present and aptitude 10 question you can select between java and python at the time of booking a slot for the qualifier round as i already told that infosys send you mail after registration on nptq as i already said that there are two programming language python and java are available you need to select for the qualifier room for the final round you also need to select before so as i told that first i will discuss the syllabus of qualifier rom and in the next slide we see that what are the some resources for the qualifier round that will help you definitely so friends these are the aptitude syllabus aptitude syllabus is same for the java candidates and for the python candidates means you can select any one of the language like either you select java or python so aptitude syllabus is same for everyone there is a 10 question of aptitude so there is a two topic so you need to understand this topic very thoroughly because this topic are very important there is a section of quantitative aptitude and there is a section of reasoning so there is a two total 10 question and there is a topic of quantitative aptitude and the reasoning so there is a sub topic that in the quantitative aptitude there are topics like algebra elixir or mixture average geometry number percentage permutation combination ratio and proportion time and distance probability so friends these are the basic topics that we discussed that we discussed below as in already in the video that this is the syllabus for the aptitude and reasoning part is also there there are the question on blood relationship data interpretation data sufficiency logical deduction logical sequence of word vein diagram statement and conclusions so friends aptitude is just a part of practicing the question so friends this is the aptitude syllabus these are the same for the java candidates and for the python candidates means you can choose either of the programming language like python or java this syllabus are the same there are the sub topic included that i already discussed moving to the next slide what about the python syllabus what about the java syllabus what about the dbms sql data structure these are the questions basically data structure oops dbms sql also they ask a question as i as i see that yes you can see that this pdf this pdf are enforces official syllabus pdf for the python programming language and for the java programming language for python and java programming language aptitude section is same means aptitude syllabus is same you can see that it is a java syllabus and you can see that it is a python syllabus for the year 2020 means for my for in my i am giving exam in 2020 here so this is the official syllabus on nvtq website for 2022 batch infosys will released soon the syllabus for the qualifier round there is no particular syllabus for the final round there is a dbms sql object or objective type questions 20 objective type questions but there is a no pro no syllabus at all for the final round but for the qualifier round there is a official syllabus you can download it from nptq i will also add this syllabus in the description i will share will i will share link for this syllabus you can check in description there will be link present you can download from it so friends these are the aptitude section they are same in the java or python and next talking about python programming so there is a different section because you can if you select java programming so this syllabus is applicable if you select python programming so this syllabus is applicable so friends i also want to add some points that they were asking about data structure and algorithms question also in python programming means a data structure an algorithm using python programming language and if you select java so data structure and algorithms using java so friends in this structure or in this syllabus there is a sub topic like there is an introduction to data structure java collection framework and generics you can see that there is a dbms syllabus also sql syllabus also but friend dbms and sql syllabus are same for the same for the python or java syllabus you can see that there is a same syllabus there is no collapse or collaboration between them but in the context of data structure algorithms and object oriented programming it can be differ because they also ask a question means there are 20 questions for a particular programming language we know but there are also question from object oriented programming data structure and algorithms and dbms so friends you need to prepare all the subjects very well like data structure algorithms if you choose python programming language you need to practice data structure and algorithms from nptq section website as you can see that this is the nptq website official website you can register for the you can register for the registration to this nptq platform there are some foundation courses in the nptq website you can see that their programming fundamental using python there is no java syllabus at all but soon it will be released there is object oriented programming using python there is data structure and algorithm using python learning dbms and sql so these are the basic courses you can see that these are the advanced courses you can see that below but you can learn also from that but these are the some important topics as you see that this all are the foundation courses you can see that you can start from the this topic here means you can start the data structure and algorithm and you need to start the all the prepare uh docu uh all the prepared syllabus that are given in the nptq on the npt official platform so friends these are the basically topics like introduction list data structure list using array option there are also assignments and there are also quiz present so friends start practicing it completely so friends these are the basic python syllabus java syllabus and dbms sql data structure oopsy syllabus so for the resources as i come to the resources for the python i refer the book learning python which is the best python book at all because this book will go to beginner to advanced level and i refer also some channels like amul's academy code with harry telescope because these are the channels which are really important for the beginner as well as for advanced candidate because you need to prepare for coding also so you need to start learning from that you need you also buy this book learning python from amazon website this is the book official you can see the preview that this book are very useful you can download it from google also so friend i refer the learning python book this our very best book this will explain your all the concepts very clearly and after that i refer online website w3school.com which are very important to crack the exam because there are some extra points in the w3 school that are very essential to learning the python so for i choose python programming language for the qualifier round so basically you can refer these resources these resources are very important so you can refer these resources as i refer for the java i use the head first java means i do not choose the programming language jama my friend choose the programming language java so you can refer the book called head first java you can officially buy on it amazon website you can see that it is ahead first java and there are the so many topics of java you can see that object oriented programming data structure java is a pass by value programming means this this is the book for advanced as well as for beginner candidate my friend also recommend a youtube channel like java by niso academy java by saurabh online website that he prefers a java t point is the best website to learn java so it are the basically resources for the qualifier now so friends these are the aptitude section for aptitude section i do not much prefer like resources like i just practicing question by rs agrawal sir book for quantitative aptitude and for reasoning i also prefer rs agrawal because i already attached the syllabus link you can prepare according for aptitude for daily question but for qualifier round you have not so much time for every question you need to solve all question in the allotted time so friends you need to refer quantitative aptitude rs aggregates a book and for reasoning you can also refer rs agrawals or book because according to your assumption according to your practice you need to practice questions of aptitude daily because you not so much have time for the uh each question so friends practice aptitude questions daily it will be very important for the qualifier round because there are total 10 question and you need to solve each question in a particular or allotted time for dbms sql database management system and sequential structured query language for the resources i prefer my university means i am pass out from rgb rajiv gandhi pradhuki vishwa dala university so i can prefer 5th sam of my btech syllabus as i also attach the link in description you can see that from below official syllabus official syllabus means you can see that i already told about i already talked about the official syllabus that is given in the python programming language section or in the given in the java programming language that introduction to dbms sql based basics ddl statement dml statement or friend i also said that you can refer all the channels like asha kilrani mem dbms lecture channel it will be present in hindi only so you can for english lecture you can prefer the sanchi genser lecture it will be also helpful for everyone you can refer to anyone from them also complete learning section from nptq platform of dbms because friends there are the question in the qualifier round are not much same as in the final exam but you can refer and you can complete the learning section from nvtq platform because it is very important that you need to you need have to pattern that this type of question are asking in the final exam so please complete learning section from nptq platform moving to the next slide dbms plus sql as i already told that data for database management system you can refer these resources and for database management system or sql for sql i prefer the website for learning sql like w3 school java t point because this is sufficient for learning sql because we can practice sql queries because they are important in both round as well as in interview because they can ask a query to write a query for this these this so friends practice query daily you need to practice query question daily and you need to prefer a quiz section from nvtq platform section there are so many questions present so you can practice from that section after that friend comes data structure and algorithms for data structure and algorithm section i also prefer i always prefer syllabus rgb syllabus for third sem because in my university data structure algorithms are two different subjects like data structure is a one subject that i read in third sem uh and algorithm is a subject that i learned in the fourth exam so i prefer third sam data structure syllabus for rgb you can also prefer or refer to your university syllabus because they are quite same topics are outgoing now but uh syllabus are quite same so i prefer third and fourth assignment rgb syllabus you can see that i prefer data structure plus analysis design of algorithm add a syllabus and i also complete learning section of nptq because it is very important to complete the learning section i also prefer youtube channels like kasha kilrani mam videos ada videos data structure videos because they also made different playlists on ada and data structure so i also complete the both videos and i also complete this section so these are very important for the data structure and algorithms section for object oriented programming section i also prefer rgb syllabus for third sem because it is quite sufficient and you can see that nptq object oriented programming course as i already said that nptq nptq section platform course is very sufficient very essential very needed because this will teach you all the courses in a short time you can complete in on by day and for the other batches like if you are in if you are pass out in 2023 or in 2024 batches you can start practicing from today because this syllabus is very important so you can complete this all syllabus like you can prefer all the class diagram tips and there are the assignments question there are the mock object oriented programming practice practice quiz so you can complete from it after that you can refer online i refer online website means i prefer online content object oriented programming in python because there are this some question in qualifier round for from object oriented programming so friends in the next video i will share you how to crack qualify around easily in first attempt or tips for cracking qualifier round i also started i also started the series of questions in next videos that how they are asking question in the qualifier round and how you can crack in your first attempt so i refer a book called ibala guru swami as we all know that ibala guru swami is a famous author and ibala guru swami for concepts like i already learned this so many concept of object oriented programming but this is the main concept that i learned but you need to make concepts learned according to your programming language as i already said that object oriented programming if you choose python so please read object oriented programming in python object data structure and algorithm using in python dbms and sql are quite same for the java and python but you need to make concept learn according to your programming language as for java you can refer another book and ebala guru is a basic book like c and c plus plus so c plus plus book is basic for all so you can prefer the nptq uh or object-oriented programming course so friends these are the some myth about qualifier round so there are the some myth that remains in the candidates that candidates will think that this is useful this programming language is useful or not so there are the some myth for qualifier on choose programming language means you can choose python versus java so some people are say that python is a very easy language you can choose that as i already choose the python programming language so most of the candidates are told most of the candidates are asked that sir can i choose python programming language for qualifier round as well as for final round as i practice friends there is no confusion at all if you are comfortable in any programming language means if you are comfortable in python programming language you can choose python if you are comfortable in java programming language you can choose java but very important point if you are choosing any one of the programming language please be sure before after selecting the programming language you cannot change for the qualify around as for final round there are the other criteria for selecting programming language but for the final round there are the selection for python versus java so if you are comfortable in any programming language below both of them like python and java you can choose between them so there is a interviewer though they ask me questions from data structure object oriented programming in python as in my interview so there is also myth that in qualifier round there are no question of data structure algorithm object oriented programming so friend this is a wrong this is totally wrong because they ask a question according like data structure object oriented programming if you are selected any language like if you are selected in python so i already told that please be prepared data structures in python if you are selected in java so please prefer data structure in java so i already shared the both the resources you can see that from data structure is the basic part as i already said that so many candidates asking there are no learning section available for data structure in java so you can prefer the uh your university syllabus for learning the data structure you can prefer online website for learning the data structure using java so there is a no collapse at all is one month is sufficient for preparation as i already candidates uh ask me that on instagram that sir there is only one month left so it is sufficient for preparation can we crack the exam in one attack can we crack the exam in first attempt or not so friends believe me this time is preparation type you need to don't worry about enforces how invoices conduct their examine after one month or two month this is just a prediction that in february 2021 infosys will conduct exam for the upcoming batches like for the 2022 batches so if the exam is delayed there is no possibility at all because if exam is delayed so they will inform all of us and after that if you have one month two months or so more month but this time is preparation you need to daily prepare for this exam because this exam so friends you can start the preparation from today for upcoming batches like 2023 and 2024 pass out you can also learn the all these sections from the nptq official website and practice all the related questions for the qualifier round and final round as you can in your third year 6m exam is exam is coming and you need to prepare and you need to participate in the exam so prepare before the time so one month is sufficient for the preparation there is no doubt at all and i will upload all the next videos with all of you soon that how i crack the final round of the final round of infosys certification how to crack final round in first attempt how to crack qualify around in first attempt tips to cracking qualify around all the necessary videos soon i will share with all of you so
